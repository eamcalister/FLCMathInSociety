  "body": " The Language and Rules of Logic   The Language and Rules of Logic   Students will be able to:     Identify propositions    Compose and interpret the negation of a statement    Use logical connectors (and\/or) and conditional statements (if, then)    Use truth tables to find truth values of basic and complex statements       Alternative Video Lesson      Logic   Logic is the study of reasoning. Our goal in this chapter is to examine arguments to determine their validity and soundness. In this section we will look at propositions and logical connectors that are the building blocks of arguments. We will also use truth tables to help us examine complex statements.    Propositions  A proposition is a complete sentence that is either true or false. Opinions can be propositions, but questions or phrases cannot.    Which of the following are propositions?   I am reading a math book.    Math is fun!    Do you like turtles?    My cat       The first and second items are propositions. The third one is a question and the fourth is a phrase, so they are not. We are not concerned right now about whether a statement is true or false. We will come back to that later when we examine full arguments.    Arguments are made of one or more propositions (called premises ), along with a conclusion . Propositions may be negated , or combined with connectors like “and”, and “or”. Let's take a closer look at how these negations and logical connectors are used to create more complex statements.    Negation (not)  One way to change a proposition is to use its negation , or opposite meaning. We often use the word not to negate a statement.    Write the negation of the following propositions.   I am reading a math book.    Math is fun!    The sky is not green.    Cars have wheels          Negation: I am not reading a math book.    Negation: Math is not fun!    Negation: The sky is green (or not not green)    Negation: Cars do not have wheels.         Multiple Negations  It is possible to use more than one negation in a statement. If you've ever said something like, I can't not go, you are really saying you must go. It's a lot like multiplying two negative numbers which gives a positive result.  In the media and in ballot measures we often see multiple negations and it can be confusing to figure out what a statement means.    Read the statement to determine the outcome of a yes vote.   Vote for this measure to repeal the ban on plastic bags.     If you said that a yes vote would enable plastic bag usage, you are correct. The ban stopped plastic bag usage, so to repeal the ban would allow it again. This measure has a double negation and is also not very good for the environment.      Read the statement to determine the outcome on mandatory minimum sentencing.   The bill that overturned the ban on mandatory minimum sentencing was vetoed.     In this case mandatory minimum sentencing would not be allowed. The ban would stop it, and the bill to overturn it was vetoed. This is an example of a triple negation.      Logical Connectors (and, or)  When we use the word and between two propositions, it connects them to create a new statement that is also a proposition. For example, if you said To finish this project, I need a screwdriver and a wrench, then you are expressing the need for both tools. For an and statement to be true, the connected propositions must both be true. If even one proposition is false (for instance, you didn't need a wrench) then the entire connected statement is false.  The word or between two propositions similarly connects the propositions to create a new statement. In this case, if you said To finish this project, I need a screwdriver or a wrench, then you are expressing the need for one of the tools (but probably not both). For an or statement to be true, at least one of the propositions must be true (or both could be true).    Exclusive vs. Inclusive or  In English we often mean for or to be exclusive : one or the other, but not both. In math, however, or is usually inclusive : one or the other, or both. The thing we are including, or excluding is the both option.    Determine whether each or statement is inclusive or exclusive.   Would you like a chicken or vegan meal?    We want to hire someone who speaks Spanish or Chinese    Are you going to wear sandals or tennis shoes?    Are you going to visit Thailand or Vietnam on your trip?       The first or statement is a choice of one or the other, but not both, so it is exclusive. The second statement is inclusive because they could find a candidate who speaks both languages. The third statement is exclusive because you can't wear both at the same time. The fourth statement is inclusive because you could visit both countries on your trip.      Conditional Statements (if, then)  A conditional statement connects two propositions with if, then . An example of a conditional statement would be If it is raining, then we'll go to the mall.   The statement If it is raining, may be true or false for any given day. If the condition is true, then we will follow the course of action and go to the mall. If the condition is false, though, we haven't said anything about what we will or won't do.    Basic Truth Tables  In logic we can use a truth table to analyze a complex statement by summarizing all the possibilities and their truth values (true or false). To do this, we break the statement down to its smallest elements, the propositions. Then we can see the outcome of the complex statement for all possible combinations of true and false for the propositions.  For example, let's work with two propositions:    R : You paid your rent this month.     E : You paid your electric bill this month.     We will use these two propositions to demonstrate the truth tables for not, and, and or.     To set up a truth table, we list all the possible truth value combinations in a systematic way. The standard way of doing this is to make the first column half true, then half false, then cut the pattern in half with each succeeding column. For two propositions, the first two columns are shown to the right.    R  E  R and E    T  T     T  F     F  T     F  F      The four possible combinations are   Row 1: You have paid your rent and electric bill    Row 2: You have paid your rent but not your electric bill    Row 3: You have not paid your rent but you have paid your electric bill    Row 4: You haven't paid either your rent or electric bill (yet).     Once we fill in the starting columns, we add additional columns for the more complex statements. We can add as many columns as needed. Below are the basic truth tables for not, and, and or.    Basic Truth Tables    Not : In the not R column, the truth value is the opposite of the value for R . For example, if R is true (you paid your rent) then not R (you did not pay your rent) is false.    R  not R    T  F    F  T       And : In the R and E column, you must have paid both your rent and electric bill. Otherwise R and E is false.    R  E  R and E    T  T  T    T  F  F    F  T  F    F  F  F       Or : In the R or E column, you must have paid either your rent or electric bill, or both (inclusive or). Otherwise R or E is false.    R  E  R or E    T  T  T    T  F  T    F  T  T    F  F  F        Conditional Truth Tables  We talked about conditional statements ( if, then statements), earlier. In logical arguments the first part (the if part) is usually a hypothesis and the second part (the then part) is a conclusion .  To understand the truth table values for a conditional statement it is helpful to look at an example. Let's say a friend tells you, If you post that photo to Facebook, you'll lose your job. Under what conditions can you say that your friend was wrong?  There are four possible outcomes:   You post the photo and lose your job    You post the photo and don't lose your job    You don't post the photo and lose your job    You don't post the photo and don't lose your job     The only case where you can say your friend was wrong is the second case, in which you post the photo but still keep your job.  Your friend didn't say anything about what would happen if you didn't post the photo, so you can't say the last two statements are wrong. Even if you didn't post the photo and lost your job anyway, your friend never said that you were guaranteed to keep your job if you didn't post it.  The four cases above correspond to the four rows of the truth table. For this truth table we will use P for posting the photo, and L for losing your job.     If, then : In the If P, then L column, the only outcome that is false is if you post the photo and don't lose your job. Otherwise If P, then L is true.    P  L  If P , then L    T  T  T    T  F  F    F  T  T    F  F  T     If the hypothesis (the if part) is false, we cannot say that the statement is a lie, so the result of the third and fourth rows is true. Notice that we are using a double negation in this explanation.  We are using the words and, or, not and if then in this book, but if you look up other resources on truth tables you are likely to see these symbols.   Symbols used in other resources   is written    is written    is written ~    is written    Practice with Symbols  More Practice with Symbols    Truth Tables for Complex Statements  Truth tables really become useful when we analyze more complex statements. In this case we will have several columns. It helps to work from the inside out and create a column in the table for each intermediate statement.    Create a truth table for the statement A or not B      When we create the truth table, we start with columns for the propositions, A and B . Then we add a column for not B because that is part of the final statement. Our last column is the final statement A or not B .    A  B  not B  A or not B    T  T      T  F      F  T      F  F        To complete the third column, not B , we take the opposite of the B column. Then to complete the fourth column, we only look at the A and the not B columns and compare them using or .    A  B  not B  A or not B    T  T  F  T    T  F  T  T    F  T  F  F    F  F  T  T         Truth Tables with Three Propositions  To create a truth table with three propositions we need eight rows for all the possible combinations. We will first determine the columns we need to get to our final statement. Then we will fill in the first three columns using the same methodology as before. Start with half true, half false, then cut the pattern in half each time.    Create a truth table for the statement A and not (B or C)     First let's figure out the columns we will need. We have A, B, C, then we need the statement in the parentheses, (B or C) . Then we need the negation of that column, not (B or C) . Then we conclude with our final statement, A and not (B or C) .  Here is the initial table:    A  B  C  B or C  not (B or C)  A and not (B or C)    T  T  T       T  T  F       T  F  T       T  F  F       F  T  T       F  T  F       F  F  T       F  F  F       Now we complete the columns one at a time. We use the B column and C column to complete B or C, . Then not (B or C) is the opposite of that column. For the final column we only need to look at the first and fifth columns, shaded in blue, with and . Here is the completed table.    A  B  C  B or C  not (B or C)  A and not (B or C)    T  T  T  T  F  F    T  T  F  T  F  F    T  F  T  T  F  F    T  F  F  F  T  T    F  T  T  T  F  F    F  T  F  T  F  F    F  F  T  T  F  F    F  F  F  F  T  F    For this statement A must be true and neither B or C can be true, so it is only true in the fourth row. For an example of this statement, let's define these propositions in the context of professional baseball:  Let A = Anaheim wins, B = Baltimore wins, C = Cleveland wins.  Suppose that Anaheim will make the playoffs if: (1) Anaheim wins, and (2) neither Boston nor Cleveland wins. TFF is the only scenario in which Anaheim will make the playoffs.      Construct a truth table for the statement if m and not p, then r .    First, it may help to add parentheses to help you clarify the order. Our statement could also be written, if (m and not p), then r . To build this table, we will build the statement in parentheses and then repeat the r column after it. It's easier to read the conditional statement from left to right. Here are the columns for the table:    m  p  r  not p  m and not p  r  If (m and not p), then r    T  T  T        T  T  F        T  F  T        T  F  F        F  T  T        F  T  F        F  F  T        F  F  F        For the fourth column, we take the opposite of p . Then we use the first and fourth columns to complete m and not p . With the r column repeated we can use columns five and six to complete our conditional statement. Here is the completed table:    m  p  r  not p  m and not p  r  If (m and not p), then r    T  T  T  F  F  T  T    T  T  F  F  F  F  T    T  F  T  T  T  T  T    T  F  F  T  T  F  F    F  T  T  F  F  T  T    F  T  F  F  F  F  T    F  F  T  T  F  T  T    F  F  F  T  F  F  T    When m is true, p is false, and r is false—the fourth row of the table—then the hypothesis m and not p will be true, but the conclusion is false, resulting in an invalid conditional statement; every other case gives a true result.  If you want a real-life situation that could be modeled by if m and not p , then r , consider this:  Let m = we order meatballs, p = we order pasta, and r = Ruba is happy.  The statement if m and not p , then r is, if we order meatballs and don't order pasta, then Ruba is happy . If m is true (we order meatballs), p is false (we don't order pasta), and r is false (Ruba is not happy), then the statement is false, because we satisfied the premise, but Ruba did not satisfy the conclusion.    In this section we have discussed propositions, logical connectors and truth tables. In the next section, we will look at set relationships before we analyze arguments.

  "body": " Describing and Critiquing Arguments   Describing and Critiquing Arguments.   Students will be able to:     Understand the structure of logical arguments by identifying the premise(s) and conclusion    Distinguish between inductive and deductive arguments    Make a set diagram to evaluate deductive arguments    Determine whether a deductive argument is valid and\/or sound       Alternative Video Lessons      Logical Arguments  A logical argument is a claim that a set of premises support a conclusion . It is possible for a logical argument to have one or many premises, but there must be one conclusion. In this section we will look at types of arguments and how to determine the strength, validity and\/or soundness of each type. There are two types of arguments we will explore in this section: inductive and deductive arguments.    Inductive and Deductive Arguments  To better understand the difference between inductive and deductive arguments, let's start by looking at a couple of examples.   Consider the following argument:  When I went to the store last week, I forgot my wallet, and I forgot it again when I went back today. I always forget my wallet when I go to the store.  Before we analyze an argument, it is helpful to precisely state its premises and its conclusion. Most arguments you encounter in the real world won't be stated in a precise premise, premise, conclusion form. Sometimes the conclusion will be stated before the premises, or the premises will be hidden within a bunch of rhetoric.  To begin our analysis of this first argument, let's first rewrite it in a more precise premise, premise, conclusion form.  Premise: I forgot my wallet when I went to the store last week.  Premise: I forgot my wallet when I went to the store today.  Conclusion: I always forget my wallet when I go to the store.  Notice that both premises make a claim about a specific instance – the specific instance last week when I forgot my wallet, and the specific instance today when I forgot my wallet. The conclusion, on the other hand, states what we can expect to happen more generally.   Now let's consider a different argument:   Henry must know CPR because he is a nurse and all nurses know CPR.  Just as we did for the last example, let's rewrite the argument in its premise, premise, conclusion form:  Premise: All nurses know CPR.  Premise: Henry is a nurse.  Conclusion: Henry knows CPR.  Unlike the first argument where the premises were specific and the conclusion was general, this argument's first premise is a general statement and the conclusion is specific. We can determine whether an argument is inductive or deductive by looking at which part of the argument is general and which is specific. In the first example, the premises were specific and the conclusion was more general. This is an example of an inductive argument. In the second example, it was the premises that were more general and the conclusion that was specific. This is an example of a deductive argument.   In general, an inductive argument uses a collection of specific examples (i.e. data) as its premises and uses them to propose a general conclusion. This is shown in the image on the left below, where the argument moves from the narrow specific premises at the bottom up to the wide general conclusion at the top. A deductive argument uses a collection of general statements (i.e. definitions) as its premises and uses them to propose a specific conclusion . This is shown in the image to the right below, where the argument moves from the wide general premises at the bottom to the narrow specific conclusion at the top.    A pyramid upside down with the narrow end at the bottom for a specific premise, the middle section is another specific premise; the wide part at the top is for the general conclusion    A pyramid right-side up with the wide base at the bottom for a general premise; another general premise in the middle section, and a specific conclusion in the narrow part at the top      Rewrite the following arguments in a precise “premise, premise, conclusion” form, and determine if the argument is inductive or deductive.   A number is prime if it is only divisible by itself and one. Since the number 13 is only divisible by itself and one, 13 must be prime.    Juan's dog Goober is having puppies. All three of Goober's previous litters have had 5 puppies so Goober is bound to have 5 puppies in this litter as well.          Premise: If a number is only divisible by itself and one, the number is prime.  Premise: The number 13 is only divisible by itself and one.  Conclusion: 13 is prime.  Since the premises are general definitions and properties of numbers and the conclusion is a specific statement about the number 13, the argument is deductive .    Premise: Goober is having puppies.  Premise: Goober's last three litters had 5 puppies.  Conclusion: Goober's current litter will have 5 puppies.  This is an example of an inductive argument since it uses specific experiences\/instances as its premises, and its conclusion is a general expectation based on those specific experiences.         Evaluating Arguments  Inductive arguments cannot be proven. The best we can do is evaluate the strength of the argument based on the evidence it provides.  A strong inductive argument is one that is well supported by its premises, while a weak inductive argument is one whose premises do a poor job of supporting the conclusion. The strength of an inductive argument is subjective, because where one person sees a strong argument, another may see a weak argument. Additionally, the strength and truth of an argument are not necessarily related; it is possible to have a weak argument that is true, and a strong argument that is false.    Determine the strength of the inductive argument.  James Franco, Jodie Foster, Jennifer Lawrence, and Jack Nicholson have all won Academy Awards for acting. Actors whose names start with J are bound to win an Academy Award.    The inductive argument provides a number of specific cases as evidence for the conclusion. However, we would not be surprised if a J-named actor did not win an Academy Award, so the argument is weak.    Deductive arguments, on the other hand, can be proven and their validity and soundness can be evaluated. The validity of the argument is based on whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises, while the soundness of the argument is based on whether or not the premises are true. An argument cannot be sound if it is not valid, even if the premises seem reasonable.    Evaluating Deductive Arguments Using Sets  One way to determine whether a deductive argument is valid is to illustrate the premises of the argument using sets and see if the conclusion logically follows if we assume the premises to be true.    Use a set diagram to determine whether the argument is valid. If the argument is valid, determine if it is also sound.    All cats are mammals and a tiger is a cat, so a tiger is a mammal.      All water bottles are plastic. This is a water bottle, so it must be plastic.      All firefighters know CPR. Jill knows CPR, so Jill must be a firefighter.      None of my friends like dancing. Kai doesn't like dancing. Therefore, Kai is my friend.      Some young adults make minimum wage and Tara is a young adult. Therefore, Tara makes minimum wage.           First let's write the argument in its premise, premise, conclusion form. For the problems we will be looking at, you will want to write the first premise as a qualified proposition (some, none, all) since this will form the basic structure of our diagram.  Premise: All cats are mammals.  Premise: A tiger is a cat.  Conclusion: A tiger is a mammal.  From the first premise we know that all cats lie inside the set of mammals (cats are a subset of mammals). From the second premise, we know that tigers lie inside the set of cats (marked with an X), and therefore also lie within the set of mammals.    A set diagram with the circle for the set of cats contained within the set of mammals. Both are in the universal set rectangle; There is an arrow for tigers pointing to the inside of the cats circle    This argument is valid because we were able to show that the conclusion follows logically from the premises. The argument is also sound since the premises all cats are mammals and a tiger is a cat are true.    From the first premise we know that all water bottles lie inside the set of plastic items (water bottles are a subset of plastic). From the second premise, we know that this particular water bottle must lie within the plastic items set.    A set diagram with the circle for the set of water bottles contained within the set of plastic. Both are in the universal set rectangle; There is an arrow for this water bottle pointing to the inside of the water bottle circle    This argument is valid because we were able to show that the conclusion follows logically from the premises. But the argument is not sound because the premise that all water bottles are plastic is not true. There are many versions of glass and metal bottles that are evidence that the first premise is not true. This argument is valid but not sound.    From the first premise we know that all firefighters lie inside the set of those who know CPR (firefighters are a subset of people who know CPR). From the second premise, we know that Jill is a member of the set of those who know CPR, but we do not have enough information to know whether she is also a member of set of firefighters.    A set diagram with the circle for the set of firefighters contained within the set of those who know CPR. Both are in the universal set rectangle; There is a question mark inside the firefighter circle and in the larger know CPR region because we don't know which region Jill is in    Since we cannot determine which group Jill must be a part of, the argument is invalid. The statement that Jill is a firefighter does not follow logically from the premises that all firefighters know CPR and that Jill knows CPR . Since the argument is not valid, it cannot be sound.      A set diagram with 2 disjoint sets, people who like to dance and my friends; Both circles are in the universal set rectangle; There is a question mark in the my friends circle and in the region outside the circles because we don't know where Kai goes.    Because it said none we draw disjoint sets – one set for my friends and a second set for people who like to dance. The second premise tells us that Kai doesn't like to dance so they're not in the set of people who like to dance. However, we can't put Kai in the set of my friends either. They could be my friend, or someone I don't know who happens to not like dancing. Therefore, the conclusion is not valid . And therefore, the arguement is also not sound .      A set diagram with 2 overlapping sets, young adults and minimum wage earners; There is a question mark in the young adults region and in the intersection of the two circles because we don't know where Tara goes.    Because it said some we draw overlapping sets. The second premise tells us to put Tara in the set of young adults, but it doesn't tell us if she makes minimum wage or not. So, like the previous example we cannot determine which region she is in. She could make minimum wage, or she could also make more. Therefore, the conclusion is not valid and therefore, not sound .         Exercises   Write whether the argument described is inductive or deductive:     The first five terms of the sequence were all odd, therefore the sixth term will also be odd.    My dog is afraid of loud noises. Today is the fourth of July, so there will be fireworks. My dog will be afraid today.         The argument is inductive.    The argument is deductive.       Find the next term of the sequences below.     3, 6, 9, 12, 15,     3, 6, 9, 15, 24,          The next term is 18.    The next term is 39.        Rewrite each of the following arguments in their premise, premise, conclusion form, and determine whether the argument is inductive or deductive. If the argument is inductive, determine its strength. If the argument is deductive, use sets to illustrate and determine the validity of the argument, and state whether the argument is valid and whether it is sound.    Since all cats are scared of vacuum cleaners and Max is a cat, Max must be scared of vacuum cleaners.   Premise: All cats are scared of vacuum cleaners.  Premise: Max is a cat.  Conclusion: Max must be scared of vacuum cleaners.  This is a deductive argument. It is valid. However, it is not sound because the premise all cats are afraid of vacuum cleaners is false. While many cats are afraid of vacuum cleaners not ALL cats are afraid. There are many videos of cats riding electronic vacuum cleaners.        Every day for the last year, a plane flew over my house at 2 pm. Therefore, a plane will always fly over my house at 2pm.   Premise: Every day for the last year, a plane flew over my house at 2pm.  Conclusion: A plane will always fly over my house at 2pm.  This is an inductive argument. It is a strong argument because a large quantity of data has been collected.    Kiran collected data on the salaries of their friends. They found that female and nonbinary friends made less than male friends, so they concluded that women and nonbinary people make less than men.   Premise: Kiran's female and nonbinary friends made less than Kiran's male friends.  Conclusion: Women and nonbinary people make less than men.  This is an inductive argument. Kiran did not gather a large diverse sample because they only asked their friends. Therefore, their data has sampling bias. This makes their argument weak.    Some of these kids are rude. Jimmy is one of these kids. Therefore, Jimmy is rude!   Premise: Some of these kids are rude.  Premise: Jimmy is one of these kids.  Conclusion: Jimmy is rude!  This is a deductive argument. This argument is not valid. Jimmy could be one of these rude kids, he could also be a kid who is not rude. Because the conclusion is not valid, it is also not sound.        All bicycles have two wheels. My friend's Harley-Davidson has two wheels, so it must be a bicycle.   Premise: All bicycles have two wheels.  Premise: My friend's Harley-Davidson motorcycle has two wheels.  Conclusion: It must be a bicycle.  This is a deductive argument. The argument is not valid. Based on the premises, we know that the friend's Harley-Davidson motorcycle has two wheels, but we do not know whethere or not it is a bicycle. Because it is not valid, it is also not sound.        Since all chocolate contains milk and this bar is made of chocolate, it must contain milk.   Premise: All chocolate contains milk.  Premise: This bar is made of chocolate.  Conclusion: It must contain milk.  This is a deductive argument. The argument is valid. This bar is in the set of chocolate and chocolate is in the set of things that contain milk. However, this conclusion is not sound because not all chocolate contains milk.        All students drink a lot of caffeine. Brayer drinks a lot of caffeine, so he must be a student.   Premise: All students drink a lot of caffeine.  Premise: Brayer drinks a lot of caffeine.  Conclusion: He must be a student.  This is a deductive argument. The argument is not valid. We can not determine if Brayer is a student or not. Because it is not valid it is also not sound.        Over the course of a year, data was collected on the number of students visiting the cafeteria. On average, there were 15-35 students present in the cafeteria during the peak hours of the data. We can expect there to be between 15 and 35 students in the cafeteria if we go during the peak hours of the day.   Premise: Over one year on average, there were 15-35 students present in the cafeteria during the peak hours.  Conclusion: There is going to be between 15 and 35 students in the cafeteria if we go during the peak hours of the day.  This is an inductive argument. This argument is strong because the conclusion is supported by the premises, they gathered a large amount of data over a long period of time on week days.    If a person is on this reality show, they must be self-absorbed. Laura is not self-absorbed. Therefore, Laura cannot be on this reality show.   Premise: People on this reality show are self-absorbed.  Premise: Laura is not self-absorbed.  Conclusion: Laura cannot be on this reality show.  This argument is deductive. The argument is valid because Laura is outside of the set of self-absorbed people, so she must also be outside of this set of people on this reality show. Determining if this conclusion is sound is more difficult because determining if someone is self-absorbed is subjective.        The first few terms of the sequence are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. Therefore, the next term will be 11.   This is a strong inductive argument because we are given specific numbers in which we can find a pattern. Then based on that pattern we can determine that the next term of the sequence would be 11.      For each of the following, draw the appropriate illustration of sets (Subset, Disjoint or Overlapping). Then put an X to represent the subject of the conclusion or put two question marks to illustrate the subject could into two locations. Finally, state if the argument is valid and whether it is sound.    Premise: No apples are pears.  Premise: A Pink Lady is an apple.  Conclusion: Therefore, a Pink Lady is not a pear.   The argument is valid and sound.        Premise: All children are young.  Premise: Tamika is young.  Conclusion: Therefore, Tamika is a child.   The argument is not valid, and it is not sound.        Premise: Some goats faint.  Premise: Fizzy faints.  Conclusion: Therefore, Fizzy is a goat.   The argument is not valid, and it is not sound.        Premise: All students who miss more than 25% of class time fail.  Premise: Claudia failed my class.  Conclusion: Claudia missed more than 25% of class time.   This argument is not valid, and because it is not valid it is also not sound. Claudia could have missed 25% of the classes causing her to fail. She could instead be failing because of low test scores.        Premise: All students who miss more than 25% of class time fail.  Premise: Ethan missed more than 25% of class time.  Conclusion: Ethan failed.   This argument is valid, and it is sound. Because Ethan is in the set of folks who missed 25% of the classes he also falls into the set of failing.        Premise: All dogs eat apples.  Premise: Mary ate an apple.  Conclusion: Mary is a dog.   This argument is not valid, and because it is not valid it is also not sound. Mary could be a dog. Mary could also be a worm, horse or human.        Premise: Some entering freshmen have to take a placement test.  Premise: Juan is an entering freshman.  Conclusion: Juan has to take a placement test.   This argument is not valid, and is not sound. We cannot determine if Juan took the test.        Premise: No cats like peanut butter.  Premise: Bob does not like peanut butter.  Conclusion: Bob is a cat.   This argument is not valid. Because it is not valid, it is also not sound. We cannot determine if Bob is a cat or not.         "

  "body": " Consider the following argument:  When I went to the store last week, I forgot my wallet, and I forgot it again when I went back today. I always forget my wallet when I go to the store.  Before we analyze an argument, it is helpful to precisely state its premises and its conclusion. Most arguments you encounter in the real world won't be stated in a precise premise, premise, conclusion form. Sometimes the conclusion will be stated before the premises, or the premises will be hidden within a bunch of rhetoric.  To begin our analysis of this first argument, let's first rewrite it in a more precise premise, premise, conclusion form.  Premise: I forgot my wallet when I went to the store last week.  Premise: I forgot my wallet when I went to the store today.  Conclusion: I always forget my wallet when I go to the store.  Notice that both premises make a claim about a specific instance – the specific instance last week when I forgot my wallet, and the specific instance today when I forgot my wallet. The conclusion, on the other hand, states what we can expect to happen more generally.  "

Just as we did for the last example, let's rewrite the argument in its premise, premise, conclusion form:  Premise: All nurses know CPR.  Premise: Henry is a nurse.  Conclusion: Henry knows CPR.  Unlike the first argument where the premises were specific and the conclusion was general, this argument's first premise is a general statement and the conclusion is specific. We can determine whether an argument is inductive or deductive by looking at which part of the argument is general and which is specific. In the first example, the premises were specific and the conclusion was more general. This is an example of an inductive argument. In the second example, it was the premises that were more general and the conclusion that was specific. This is an example of a deductive argument.  "

A number is prime if it is only divisible by itself and one. Since the number 13 is only divisible by itself and one, 13 must be prime.    Juan's dog Goober is having puppies. All three of Goober's previous litters have had 5 puppies so Goober is bound to have 5 puppies in this litter as well.          Premise: If a number is only divisible by itself and one, the number is prime.  Premise: The number 13 is only divisible by itself and one.  Conclusion: 13 is prime.  Since the premises are general definitions and properties of numbers and the conclusion is a specific statement about the number 13, the argument is deductive .    Premise: Goober is having puppies.  Premise: Goober's last three litters had 5 puppies.  Conclusion: Goober's current litter will have 5 puppies.  This is an example of an inductive argument since it uses specific experiences\/instances as its premises, and its conclusion is a general expectation based on those specific experiences.      "

  "body": "  Use a set diagram to determine whether the argument is valid. If the argument is valid, determine if it is also sound.    All cats are mammals and a tiger is a cat, so a tiger is a mammal.      All water bottles are plastic. This is a water bottle, so it must be plastic.      All firefighters know CPR. Jill knows CPR, so Jill must be a firefighter.      None of my friends like dancing. Kai doesn't like dancing. Therefore, Kai is my friend.      Some young adults make minimum wage and Tara is a young adult. Therefore, Tara makes minimum wage.           First let's write the argument in its premise, premise, conclusion form. For the problems we will be looking at, you will want to write the first premise as a qualified proposition (some, none, all) since this will form the basic structure of our diagram.  Premise: All cats are mammals.  Premise: A tiger is a cat.  Conclusion: A tiger is a mammal.  From the first premise we know that all cats lie inside the set of mammals (cats are a subset of mammals). From the second premise, we know that tigers lie inside the set of cats (marked with an X), and therefore also lie within the set of mammals.    A set diagram with the circle for the set of cats contained within the set of mammals. Both are in the universal set rectangle; There is an arrow for tigers pointing to the inside of the cats circle    This argument is valid because we were able to show that the conclusion follows logically from the premises. The argument is also sound since the premises all cats are mammals and a tiger is a cat are true.    From the first premise we know that all water bottles lie inside the set of plastic items (water bottles are a subset of plastic). From the second premise, we know that this particular water bottle must lie within the plastic items set.    A set diagram with the circle for the set of water bottles contained within the set of plastic. Both are in the universal set rectangle; There is an arrow for this water bottle pointing to the inside of the water bottle circle    This argument is valid because we were able to show that the conclusion follows logically from the premises. But the argument is not sound because the premise that all water bottles are plastic is not true. There are many versions of glass and metal bottles that are evidence that the first premise is not true. This argument is valid but not sound.    From the first premise we know that all firefighters lie inside the set of those who know CPR (firefighters are a subset of people who know CPR). From the second premise, we know that Jill is a member of the set of those who know CPR, but we do not have enough information to know whether she is also a member of set of firefighters.    A set diagram with the circle for the set of firefighters contained within the set of those who know CPR. Both are in the universal set rectangle; There is a question mark inside the firefighter circle and in the larger know CPR region because we don't know which region Jill is in    Since we cannot determine which group Jill must be a part of, the argument is invalid. The statement that Jill is a firefighter does not follow logically from the premises that all firefighters know CPR and that Jill knows CPR . Since the argument is not valid, it cannot be sound.      A set diagram with 2 disjoint sets, people who like to dance and my friends; Both circles are in the universal set rectangle; There is a question mark in the my friends circle and in the region outside the circles because we don't know where Kai goes.    Because it said none we draw disjoint sets – one set for my friends and a second set for people who like to dance. The second premise tells us that Kai doesn't like to dance so they're not in the set of people who like to dance. However, we can't put Kai in the set of my friends either. They could be my friend, or someone I don't know who happens to not like dancing. Therefore, the conclusion is not valid . And therefore, the arguement is also not sound .      A set diagram with 2 overlapping sets, young adults and minimum wage earners; There is a question mark in the young adults region and in the intersection of the two circles because we don't know where Tara goes.    Because it said some we draw overlapping sets. The second premise tells us to put Tara in the set of young adults, but it doesn't tell us if she makes minimum wage or not. So, like the previous example we cannot determine which region she is in. She could make minimum wage, or she could also make more. Therefore, the conclusion is not valid and therefore, not sound .      "

  "title": "Logical Fallacies",
  "body": " Logical Fallacies   Logical Fallacies.   Students will be able to:     Identify common logical fallacies and their use in arguments      Logical Fallacies  In the last section we saw that logical arguments are invalid when the premises are not sufficient to guarantee the conclusion, and that even if an argument is valid it may be unsound if the premises are not true. There are other ways that a logical argument might be invalid or unsound. One of the more common ways this can occur is if the argument is a fallacy .  A fallacy is a type of argument that appears valid but uses a logical error to persuade or deceive. Fallacious arguments are especially common in advertising and politics, so it is important as informed citizens to recognize when we are being presented with a fallacious argument and to not be persuaded by it.    Common Logical Fallacies  There are many logical fallacies, and some go by more than one name. Below we introduce a few of the more common fallacies that you will be asked to recognize by name, but there are many others.    Personal Attack (Ad hominem)  A personal attack argument attacks the person making the argument while ignoring the argument itself. A personal attack is not the same as an insult. Rather, a personal attack claims that there is something wrong with the person or group in order to cast doubt on their character and discredit their argument.    Jane says that whales are fish, but she's only in the second grade so she can't be right.   Here the argument is attacking Jane, not the validity of her claim, so this is a personal attack.     Jane says that whales are fish, but everyone knows that they're really mammals. She's so stupid.   This certainly isn't very nice, but it is not a personal attack since a valid counterargument is made ( they really are mammals ) along with a personal insult.     Mr. Smith is a college dropout, so his stance on education reform cannot be trusted.   Here the argument uses the fact that Mr. Smith did not complete their college degree to discredit their ideas on education reform, so it is a personal attack.     Appeal to Ignorance  An appeal to ignorance argument assumes something is true because it hasn't been proven false.    Nobody has proven that photo isn't of Bigfoot, so it must be Bigfoot.   This is an example of an appeal to ignorance since the fact that no one has been able to prove the picture of Bigfoot is false is being used as evidence that it is Bigfoot.     Appeal to Authority  An appeal to authority argument attempts to use the authority of a person to prove a claim. An authority could be an expert such as a doctor or scholar, or someone who is admired like a celebrity or sports figure. While an authority can provide strength to an argument, problems can occur when the person's opinion is not shared by other experts, or when the authority is irrelevant to the claim.    A diet high in bacon can be healthy; Doctor Atkins said so.   Here, an appeal to a doctor's authority is used for the argument. This generally would provide strength to the argument, except that the opinion that eating a diet high in saturated fat runs counter to general medical opinion. More supporting evidence would be needed to justify this claim.     Jennifer Hudson and Oprah lost weight with Weight Watchers, so their program must work.   In this example there is an appeal to the authority of celebrities. While their experience does provide evidence, it provides no more than any other person's experience would.     False Dilemma  A false dilemma argument falsely frames an argument as an either or choice without allowing for additional options.    Either those lights in the sky were an airplane or aliens. There are no airplanes scheduled for tonight, so it must be aliens.   This argument is a false dilemma since it ignores the possibility that the lights could be something other than an airplane or aliens.     Straw Man (or Straw Person)  A straw person argument involves misrepresenting the argument in an oversimplified, distorted and less favorable way to make it easier to attack.    Senator Khouri has proposed reducing military spending by 10%. Apparently, she wants to leave us defenseless against attacks by terrorists.   Here the arguer has represented a 10% funding cut as equivalent to leaving us defenseless, making it easier to attack Senator Khouri's position.     Post Hoc  A post hoc argument claims that because two things happened sequentially, then the first must have caused the second.    Every morning the rooster crows just before dawn. It must be his crow that makes the sun rise.   Here the arguer is saying the rooster caused the sun to rise, but it is more likely that the sun rising caused the rooster to crow.     Today I wore a red shirt and my football team won! I need to wear a red shirt every time they play to make sure they keep winning.   This person is saying their team won because they wore a red shirt. This type of superstition is quite common in sports even though we really know they are unrelated.   Sometimes there may be more than one fallacy that seems reasonable. Consider this argument: Emma Watson says she's a feminist, but she posed for these racy pictures. I'm a feminist and no self-respecting feminist would do that. Could this be ad hominem, saying that Emma Watson has no self-respect? Could it be appealing to authority because the person making the argument claims to be a feminist? Could it be a false dilemma because the argument assumes that a woman is either a feminist or not, with no gray area in between?  We have described just six of the many types of logical fallacies. Once you learn to recognize these you will also likely become aware of many others. There are many lists of logical fallacies online.    Exercises    Determine which type of fallacy each argument represents.    John Bardeen's work at the Advanced Institute for Physics has progressed so slowly that even his colleagues call him a plodder. Hence, it is prudent at present not to take seriously his current theory relating how strings constitute the smallest of subatomic particles.   Personal attack    You will tell the general manager that I made the right choice in dealing with that customer. After all, I'm the shift manager, so my decisions are always right.   Appeal to authority    It was his fault, Officer. You can tell by the kind of car I'm driving and by my clothes that I am a good citizen and would not lie. Look at the rattletrap he is driving and look at how he is dressed. You can't believe anything a dirty, longhaired hippie like that might tell you. Search his car; he probably has pot in it.   Personal Dilemma    We can go to the amusement park or the library. The amusement park is too expensive, so we must go to the library.   False dilemma    Nearly all heroin addicts used marijuana before trying heroin. Clearly marijuana use leads to heroin addiction.   Post Hoc    The oven was working fine until you started using it, so you must have broken it.   Post Hoc    Old man Brown claims that he saw a flying saucer in his farm, but he never got beyond the fourth grade in school and can hardly read or write. He is completely ignorant of what scientists have written on the subject, so his report cannot possibly be true.   Personal Attack    You should use Sparkle brand toothpaste since four out of five dentists recommend it.   Appeal to authority    She didn't say that I couldn't borrow her car, so I figured it was fine if I borrowed it for the weekend.   Appeal to ignorance    If you think that teens should be taught about contraceptive measures then you want to give kids license to have sex with no consequences.   Straw person    You're either part of the solution or part of the problem.   False dilemma    No one can prove that God exists, therefore God does not exist.   Appeal to ignorance    You're clearly just too young to understand.   Personal attack    You should start off every morning with Champions brand cereal. It is what Michael Jordan eats, so you know that it must be very good for you.   Appeal to authority    No one on the council objected to the idea that he proposed, so everyone must think it is a good idea.   Appeal to ignorance    Why should we believe your testimony? You haven't had a steady job since 2003.   Personal attack    A huge percentage of diagnosed cases of autism came very soon after vaccinations for the measles. These vaccinations must be causing autism.   Post Hoc    If you are against this war then you must hate America.   Straw person    Just look at her face. How could anyone vote for that?   Personal Attack     There are a number of fallacies that were not discussed in this section. Do an internet search for the following fallacies. Provide both a definition and at least one example.   Slippery Slope    Circular Reasoning    Appeal to Emotion    Red Herring    Whataboutism      Answers will vary.    "

  "body": " Contingency Tables   Contingency Tables   Students will be able to:      Calculate percentages from a contingency table    Calculate and empirical probabilities    Calculate or empirical probabilities    Calculate conditional probabilities    Determine whether two characteristics are independent       Alternative Video Lesson    In the next chapter we will study different types of data at length. In order to discuss probability we must first introduce a certain type of data called categorical data . This is data that allows us to classify objects into categories. A categorical variable is a way of describing an object in terms of categorical data. Here are a few examples:    Variable: Type of phone owned by a person.   Possible Values: Iphone, Android  This variable classifies a person by the type of phone they own.     Variable: Type of motor in a car.   Possible Values: Gasoline, Diesel, Electric  This variable classifies a car by the type of motor that propels it.     Variable: (Primary) position of a major league baseball player.   Possible Values: Pitcher, Catcher, 1st Base, 2nd Base, Shortstop, 3rd Base, Right Field, Center Field, Left, Field, Designated Hitter  This variable classifies a baseball player by their position. We have to indicate that this is their primary position because a player may play more than one position, but there is one that they play most.       Contingency Tables  A contingency table summarizes all the possible combinations for two categorical variables. Each value in the table represents the number of times a particular combination of outcomes occurs. For example, suppose we randomly select 250 households from the greater Portland area and ask whether they have a cat and whether they have a dog. In this case, have a cat and have a dog are the two variables, and each variable has two categories: Yes and No. To create the contingency table, we make columns for the categories of one variable, and rows for the categories of the other variable. We also add a row and column for the subtotals of each category. Each cell of the resulting table contains the number of outcomes having the characteristics of the intersecting row and column categories. For our dog and cat example, the table would look like this:     Dog  No Dog  Total    Cat  Yes Cat and Yes Dog  Yes Cat and No Dog  Yes Cat Total    No Cat  No Cat and Yes Dog  No Cat and No Dog  No Cat Total    Total  Yes Dog Total  No Dog Total  Grand total    Suppose that of the 250 households surveyed, 180 said they have a cat, 95 said they have a dog, and 52 said they have both a cat and a dog. We can use this information to fill in the cells of the table.     Dog  No Dog  Total    Cat  52   180    No Cat       Total  95   250    The first cell we can fill in is the grand total , which is the total number of subjects in the study. In this case, there are 250 households participating in the survey. The next two cells we can fill in are the total number of households that have a cat, 180, and the total number of households that have a dog, 95. The final cell we can fill in from the given information is the intersection of the having a dog column and a having a cat row, which is 52 households.  Since each row and column must sum to their totals, we can use subtraction to find the missing numbers as shown below.     Dog  No Dog  Total    Cat  52   180    No Cat   or     Total  95   250    Now that we have our contingency table completed, notice that the numbers in the central four cells add to the grand total as shown in the table on the left. The total row and the total column also add to the grand total as shown in the right table.      Dog  No Dog  Total    Cat  52  128  180    No Cat  43  27  70    Total  95  155  250       Dog  No Dog  Total    Cat  52  128  180    No Cat  43  27  70    Total  95  155  250        And Statements  Now we can use the contingency table to determine the percentage of households that meet certain conditions. For instance, what percent of those surveyed own a cat and do not own a dog?   In the contingency table we see the 128 households at the intersection of the row of households who own a cat and the column of households who do not own a dog. As a percentage, the total number of households surveyed, is or 51.2% that have a cat and no dog.     Dog  No Dog  Total    Cat  52  128  180    No Cat  43  27  70    Total  95  155  250      Or Statements  How about the percentage of households surveyed that have a cat or a dog?  We can get the answer from the contingency table. By adding the cells for households who have a cat and not a dog, a dog and not a cat, and the households that have both a cat and a dog. This gives us 223 households.  There is another way to calculate an or statements from a contingency table. We could add the row and column totals for having a cat and having a dog, but then we have counted the 52 households in the intersection twice. We can subtract that number to get households with a dog or a cat, which we know is 89.2% of those surveyed.     Dog  No Dog  Total    Cat  52  128  180    No Cat  43  27  70    Total  95  155  250      Conditional Statements  Another question we can answer using a contingency table is what percentage of dog owning households also own a cat? In this case the group that we are interested in isn't every household surveyed (the grand total), but just those households that own a dog.     Dog  No Dog  Total    Cat  52  128  180    No Cat  43  27  70    Total  95  155  250    We call this a conditional statement because we are only considering the households with a certain condition. If we focus on the column representing the households that own a dog, we see that there is a total of 95 households with a dog, and that 52 of those 95 households also have a cat. Therefore, or approximately 54.7% of the households with a dog also have a cat. Another way to phrase this conditional statement is, What percent of households have a cat given they have a dog. You will see the word given quite a bit in this chapter and that makes the denominator change.     Contingency Tables with More Than Two Categories     910 randomly sampled registered voters from Tampa, FL were asked if they thought workers who have illegally entered the US should (i) be allowed to keep their jobs and apply for US citizenship, (ii) be allowed to keep their jobs as temporary guest workers but not be allowed to apply for US citizenship, or (iii) lose their jobs and have to leave the country. Not sure was also an option (iv). The results of the survey by political ideology are shown below SurveyUSA, News Poll #18927 , data collected Jan 27-29, 2012. Example adapted from Open Intro: Advanced High School Statistics , by Diez et al, used under CC-BY-SA 3.0 . . Use the contingency table to answer the questions.     Conservative  Moderate  Liberal  Total    (i) Apply for citizenship  57  120  101  278    (ii) Guest worker  121  113  28  262    (iii) Leave the country  179  126  45  350    (iv) Not sure  15  4  1  20    Total  372  363  175  910       What percent of the sampled Tampa, FL voters identified themselves as conservatives?    What percent of the sampled voters are in favor of the citizenship option?    What percent of the sampled voters identify themselves as conservatives and are in favor of the citizenship option?    What percent of the sampled voters identify themselves as liberal or are in favor of the leaving the country option?    What percent of the sampled voters who identify as conservatives are also in favor of the citizenship option? What percent of moderate and liberal voters share this view?          To answer this question, we find the conservative column and look to the bottom cell for the total number of conservative voters and divide that by the total number of voters surveyed. This gives us or approximately 41% of the Tampa, FL voters who identify as conservative.    For this question we find the apply for citizenship row, look across to find the total, and divide this by the total number of voters surveyed. We get or approximately 31% of these voters are in favor of the citizenship option.    For this question we are looking for the cell that is the intersection of those who identify as conservative and those who are in favor of the citizen option. This cell has 57 voters, so we divide that by the total number of voters. This gives us or or approximately 6.3% of these voters identify as conservatives and are in favor of the citizenship option.    The or in this question is inclusive, so we need to determine the number of voters who identify as liberal, who are in favor of the leaving the country option, or both.     Conservative  Moderate  Liberal  Total    (i) Apply for citizenship  57  120  101  278    (ii) Guest worker  121  113  28  262    (iii) Leave the country  179  126  45  350    (iv) Not sure  15  4  1  20    Total  372  363  175  910    In terms of the individual cells, the number of voters who have the specified characteristics is the sum , which we can divide by the total number of voters surveyed to get the percent. So, we have or approximately 53% of the voters identify as liberal or are in favor of the leave the country option.  Another way to calculate this is to add the total number who identify as liberal (175 voters) and the total number who are in favor of the leave the country option (350 voters), then subtract the double counted cell (45 voters) who are liberal and in favor of the leave the country option:     As we saw before, these are conditional statements. For the first part of this question, we want to focus just on those voters who identify as conservatives, and from among that group determine the percent in favor of the citizenship option. We calculate that or approximately 15% of conservative voters are in favor of the citizenship option.  For the second part, we want to focus on just those voters who identify as moderate, and from among that group determine the percent in favor of the citizenship option. Then we have or approximately 33% of moderate voters are in favor of the citizen option.  Finally, we want to focus on just those voters who identify as liberal, and from among that group determine the percent in favor of the citizenship option. We calculate or approximately 58% of liberal voters are in favor of the citizenship option. Looking at these three percentages, it is clear that support of the citizenship option depends on political ideology. If support of the citizenship option were the same across political ideologies, then we would say that favoring the citizenship option and political ideology were independent of each other.         Empirical Probability  If our sample is representative of the population, then we can also interpret a percentage we calculate from a contingency table as a probability , or the likelihood that something will happen. Since a contingency table is constructed from data collected through sampling or an experiment, we call it an empirical or experimental probability. This is different from a theoretical probability which we will look at in the next section.    Finding Empirical Probabilities with a Contingency Table  Suppose that 60% of students in our class have a summer birthday (June, July, or August). Now suppose everyone's name and birth month are written on slips of paper and thrown into a bag. If we pull a slip of paper out of the bag at random, what is the probability that the selected student has a summer birthday? If you think there should be a 60% chance, you are right! The relative frequency of the characteristic of interest will be equal to its empirical probability. To write this as a probability statement, it would look like     Probability is a function named P , and the function is applied to what follows in the parentheses. Let's look at another example where we write probability statements and find empirical probabilities.    A survey of licensed drivers asked whether they had received a speeding ticket in the last year and whether their car is red. The results of the survey are shown in the contingency table to the right.     Speeding Ticket  No Speeding Ticket  Total    Red Car  15  135  150    Not Red Car  45  470  515    Total  60  605  665    Find the probability that a randomly selected survey participant:   has a red car.    has had a speeding ticket in the last year.    has a red car and has not had a speeding ticket in the last year.    has a red car or has had a speeding ticket in the last year.    has had a speeding ticket in the last year given they have a red car.    who has received a speeding ticket in the last year also has a red car.    What do the answers to b and e suggest about the relationship between owning a red car and getting a speeding ticket?             Speeding Ticket  No Speeding Ticket  Total    Red Car  15  135  150    Not Red Car  45  470  515    Total  60  605  665    To find , we divide the number of participants who own a red car by the total number of people surveyed: or 22.6%.       Speeding Ticket  No Speeding Ticket  Total    Red Car  15  135  150    Not Red Car  45  470  515    Total  60  605  665     , we divide the number of participants who got a speeding ticket in the last year by the total number of people surveyed: or 9%.       Speeding Ticket  No Speeding Ticket  Total    Red Car  15  135  150    Not Red Car  45  470  515    Total  60  605  665    To find , we find the intersection of the red car category and the no ticket category and divide by the total number of participants: or 20.3%       Speeding Ticket  No Speeding Ticket  Total    Red Car  15  135  150    Not Red Car  45  470  515    Total  60  605  665    To find , we need to add those who drive a red car and did not have a speeding ticket (just red), those who had a speeding ticket and do not drive a red car (just ticket) and those who drive a red car and had a speeding ticket (both), and divide by the total number of participants:     Recall from our earlier discussion that we could also calculate the or probability as:     which gives us the same answer as counting the individual cells.       Speeding Ticket  No Speeding Ticket  Total    Red Car  15  135  150    Not Red Car  45  470  515    Total  60  605  665    The probability is a conditional probability as we have seen before since it is conditional on the given characteristic occurring. In this problem, the given characteristic is owning a red car, so we isolate our attention to just the row of 150 red car owners and see how many have had a speeding ticket in the last year. Looking at the table, we see that there were 15 red car owners who had a speeding ticket in the last year, so we calculate:          Speeding Ticket  No Speeding Ticket  Total    Red Car  15  135  150    Not Red Car  45  470  515    Total  60  605  665    This question is also asking for a conditional probability, , but it is phrased more like we would say it. In this case the given characteristic is that the person has received a speeding ticket, so we will isolate our attention to just the speeding ticket column. Among the 60 people who had a speeding ticket in the last year, we see that 15 also drove a red car. Now we can calculate the probability:     Notice that compared with part e, when we change the conditional characteristic, we change the denominator of the fraction.    In part b, we determined that there was a 9% chance of randomly selecting a participant who had received a speeding ticket in the last year. However, in part e we found that there was a 25% chance of receiving a ticket in the last year if the person had a red car. This seems to suggest that there is a higher likelihood of getting a speeding ticket if you own a red car. This means that getting a speeding ticket is dependent on whether the person drives a red car, since that increases the probability of getting a ticket. We cannot say, however, whether driving a red car makes you speed or whether people who tend to drive faster buy red cars.         Conditional Probabilities  We have mentioned conditional probabilities, which we find by isolating our attention to the given row or column. Here is another example of finding conditional probabilities.    A home pregnancy test was given to a sample of 93 cisgender women, and their pregnancy was then verified by a blood test. The contingency table below shows the home pregnancy test and whether or not they were actually pregnant as determined by the blood test. Find the probability that a randomly selected woman in the sample   was not pregnant given the home test was positive.    had a positive home pregnancy test given they were not pregnant.        Positive Test  Negative Test  Total    Pregnant  70  4  74    Not Pregnant  5  14  19    Total  75  18  93      Here are the solutions:   Since we are given the home test result was positive, we are limited to the 75 women in the positive test column, of which 5 were not pregnant. This gives:     Positive Test  Negative Test  Total    Pregnant  70  4  74    Not Pregnant  5  14  19    Total  75  18  93         Since we are given the woman is not pregnant, we are limited to the 19 women in the not pregnant row, of which 5 had a positive test. This gives:     Positive Test  Negative Test  Total    Pregnant  70  4  74    Not Pregnant  5  14  19    Total  75  18  93       This result is referred to as a false positive: A positive test result when the woman is not actually pregnant.       In this section we have learned about empirical probability. In the next section we will discuss another kind of probability that you may be familiar with – theoretical probability.

Yes, it does appear that survival depended on the passenger's class. The probability of survival for first class passengers is significantly greater than the probability of survival for second class passengers and is more than double the probability of survival for third class passengers.

  "body": "  910 randomly sampled registered voters from Tampa, FL were asked if they thought workers who have illegally entered the US should (i) be allowed to keep their jobs and apply for US citizenship, (ii) be allowed to keep their jobs as temporary guest workers but not be allowed to apply for US citizenship, or (iii) lose their jobs and have to leave the country. Not sure was also an option (iv). The results of the survey by political ideology are shown below SurveyUSA, News Poll #18927 , data collected Jan 27-29, 2012. Example adapted from Open Intro: Advanced High School Statistics , by Diez et al, used under CC-BY-SA 3.0 . . Use the contingency table to answer the questions.     Conservative  Moderate  Liberal  Total    (i) Apply for citizenship  57  120  101  278    (ii) Guest worker  121  113  28  262    (iii) Leave the country  179  126  45  350    (iv) Not sure  15  4  1  20    Total  372  363  175  910       What percent of the sampled Tampa, FL voters identified themselves as conservatives?    What percent of the sampled voters are in favor of the citizenship option?    What percent of the sampled voters identify themselves as conservatives and are in favor of the citizenship option?    What percent of the sampled voters identify themselves as liberal or are in favor of the leaving the country option?    What percent of the sampled voters who identify as conservatives are also in favor of the citizenship option? What percent of moderate and liberal voters share this view?          To answer this question, we find the conservative column and look to the bottom cell for the total number of conservative voters and divide that by the total number of voters surveyed. This gives us or approximately 41% of the Tampa, FL voters who identify as conservative.    For this question we find the apply for citizenship row, look across to find the total, and divide this by the total number of voters surveyed. We get or approximately 31% of these voters are in favor of the citizenship option.    For this question we are looking for the cell that is the intersection of those who identify as conservative and those who are in favor of the citizen option. This cell has 57 voters, so we divide that by the total number of voters. This gives us or or approximately 6.3% of these voters identify as conservatives and are in favor of the citizenship option.    The or in this question is inclusive, so we need to determine the number of voters who identify as liberal, who are in favor of the leaving the country option, or both.     Conservative  Moderate  Liberal  Total    (i) Apply for citizenship  57  120  101  278    (ii) Guest worker  121  113  28  262    (iii) Leave the country  179  126  45  350    (iv) Not sure  15  4  1  20    Total  372  363  175  910    In terms of the individual cells, the number of voters who have the specified characteristics is the sum , which we can divide by the total number of voters surveyed to get the percent. So, we have or approximately 53% of the voters identify as liberal or are in favor of the leave the country option.  Another way to calculate this is to add the total number who identify as liberal (175 voters) and the total number who are in favor of the leave the country option (350 voters), then subtract the double counted cell (45 voters) who are liberal and in favor of the leave the country option:     As we saw before, these are conditional statements. For the first part of this question, we want to focus just on those voters who identify as conservatives, and from among that group determine the percent in favor of the citizenship option. We calculate that or approximately 15% of conservative voters are in favor of the citizenship option.  For the second part, we want to focus on just those voters who identify as moderate, and from among that group determine the percent in favor of the citizenship option. Then we have or approximately 33% of moderate voters are in favor of the citizen option.  Finally, we want to focus on just those voters who identify as liberal, and from among that group determine the percent in favor of the citizenship option. We calculate or approximately 58% of liberal voters are in favor of the citizenship option. Looking at these three percentages, it is clear that support of the citizenship option depends on political ideology. If support of the citizenship option were the same across political ideologies, then we would say that favoring the citizenship option and political ideology were independent of each other.      "

Speeding Ticket  No Speeding Ticket  Total    Red Car  15  135  150    Not Red Car  45  470  515    Total  60  605  665    The probability is a conditional probability as we have seen before since it is conditional on the given characteristic occurring. In this problem, the given characteristic is owning a red car, so we isolate our attention to just the row of 150 red car owners and see how many have had a speeding ticket in the last year. Looking at the table, we see that there were 15 red car owners who had a speeding ticket in the last year, so we calculate:          Speeding Ticket  No Speeding Ticket  Total    Red Car  15  135  150    Not Red Car  45  470  515    Total  60  605  665    This question is also asking for a conditional probability, , but it is phrased more like we would say it. In this case the given characteristic is that the person has received a speeding ticket, so we will isolate our attention to just the speeding ticket column. Among the 60 people who had a speeding ticket in the last year, we see that 15 also drove a red car. Now we can calculate the probability:     Notice that compared with part e, when we change the conditional characteristic, we change the denominator of the fraction.    In part b, we determined that there was a 9% chance of randomly selecting a participant who had received a speeding ticket in the last year. However, in part e we found that there was a 25% chance of receiving a ticket in the last year if the person had a red car. This seems to suggest that there is a higher likelihood of getting a speeding ticket if you own a red car. This means that getting a speeding ticket is dependent on whether the person drives a red car, since that increases the probability of getting a ticket. We cannot say, however, whether driving a red car makes you speed or whether people who tend to drive faster buy red cars.      "

We calculated empirical or experimental probabilities using contingency tables. In this section, we will focus on theoretical probability and compare the two types.   Alternative Video Lessons      Basic Probability Concepts  Let's begin with a brief introduction to some of the language and basic concepts of theoretical probability.    Experiment  If you roll a die, pick a card from a deck of playing cards, or randomly select a person and observe their hair color, you are conducting an experiment .    Events and Outcomes  The result of an experiment is an outcome . An event is any particular group of outcomes, like rolling a three or a five on a die. An event can be a simple event , which is a single outcome, or a combination of outcomes, called a compound event .    Sample Space  The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes. For example, if we roll a six-sided die, the sample space is the set .    If we roll an eight-sided die, describe the sample space and give at least two examples of simple events and compound events.    The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes, or equivalently, all simple events:   Examples of simple events are rolling a 1, rolling a 5, rolling a 6, and so on. Examples of compound events include rolling an even number, rolling a 5 or a 3, and rolling a number that is at least 4.      Equally Likely Outcomes  When the outcomes of an experiment are equally likely, we can calculate the probability of an event as the number of ways it can happen out of the total number of outcomes.   Theoretical Probability      We can write the result as a simplified fraction or as a decimal or percent.    Write the sample space for the sum of two fair six-sided dice and determine whether the outcomes are equally likely.    The sample space for the sum of two fair six-sided dice is . The different sums, however, are not equally likely. If we look at a table of the different possible outcomes when rolling two dice, we see that there are 36 possible combinations. We will summarize this in a table by listing each outcome in the sample space. Then we find the probabilities by counting the number of ways each sum can occur and dividing it by 36.     1  2  3  4  5  6    1          2          3          4          5          6             Sum  Probability    2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9     10     11     12     From the probability table we can see that rolling a sum of 7 has the highest probability and rolling a 2 or a 12 have the lowest probabilities.      Suppose we roll a fair six-sided die. Calculate the probability of:   rolling a 6.    rolling a number that is at least 4.    rolling an even number.    rolling a 5 or a 3.       Recall that the sample space is . Since each of the outcomes in the sample space is equally likely, we can find the probability of each event by counting the number of outcomes corresponding to the event and dividing by 6, the total number of equally likely outcomes.   There is only one way to roll a 6, so or approximately 16.7% There is a 16.7% chance of rolling a 6.    In probability we will often come across the phrases at least and at most.  At least means that value or greater. At most means that value or less. Since we are looking for the probability of rolling a number that is at least 4, we need the number of outcomes that are 4 or greater. There are 3 values that meet this condition: 4, 5, and 6. The probability is or 50%    Half of the numbers on a die are even, so we calculate: or 50%    There are two ways to roll a 5 or a 3, so or approxiamtely 33.3%. There is a 33.3% chance of rolling a 5 or a 3.         Suppose you have a bag containing 14 sweet cherries and 6 sour cherries. If you pick a cherry at random, what is the probability it will be sweet?    Each of the cherries are equally likely to be selected since our selection is random and we can assume there is no way to distinguish one cherry from another. This means that the probability of selecting a sweet cherry will be equal to the number of sweet cherries in the bag dived by the total number of cherries in the bag. Since there are 14 sweet cherries and a total of 20 cherries in the bag, we have:     There is a 70% chance of selecting a sweet cherry from the bag.      Certain and Impossible Events  A probability is always a value between 0 and 1, or from 0% to 100%. If the probability of an event is 0 there are no outcomes that correspond with that event and we say it is impossible . If the probability of an event is 1 then every outcome corresponds to that event and we say it is certain .       What is the probability of rolling an odd or even number on a six-sided die?    What is the probability of rolling an 8 on a six-sided die?          Since all the numbers are either even or odd, this event includes all of the outcomes in the sample space. This event is certain.     Since 8 is not one of the outcomes in the sample space, the event is impossible.          Complementary Events  The complement of an event means does not happen. We can refer to the complement as . For example, consider the experiment of rolling a six-sided die and the simple event = rolling a 6. The complement of event is everything in the sample space that is not a 6: .    Notice that the outcomes from set A and the outcomes from set will together equal the entire sample space. The probabilities must add up to 1 or 100%. Therefore, we can use subtraction to find the probability of a complement.   Complement of an Event        If you roll an eight-sided die, what's the probability you don't get a 6?    Not rolling a 6 is the complement of rolling a 6, which is easier to calculate. Since there are 8 possible numbers to roll, we have:     There is an 87.5% chance of not rolling a 6.      Experimental vs. Theoretical Probability  Now that we have calculated experimental and theoretical probabilities, we can compare them. When we flip a fair coin, we say there is a 50% chance of getting heads. This is a theoretical probability because there are two equally likely outcomes - heads and tails - so we expect to get heads half of the time. But if you flip a coin, say 100 times, will you get heads exactly 50 times? Maybe, but you are more likely to get some number around 50 times. The number of heads you actually observe out of the total number of times you flip the coin is the experimental probability.    The table shows the numbers that came up after rolling a six-sided die 10 times. What is the experimental probability of rolling a 6? What is the theoretical probability of rolling a 6?    Roll  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10    Outcome  3  1  4  6  6  6  1  3  5  1      To find the experimental probability of rolling a 6, it would be helpful to change this into a frequency table. We list all the possible outcomes and count how many times each occurred.    Outcome  Frequency    1  3    2  0    3  2    4  1    5  1    6  3    According to our frequency table, we see that a 6 was rolled three times, so the experimental probability of rolling a 6 is or 30%.  Theoretically, however, we would expect the number 6 to come up 1 out of 6 times since there are 6 equally likely outcomes. Thus, the theoretical probability of rolling a 6 is or approximately 16.7%      The Law of Large Numbers  As we saw in the previous example, theoretical and experimental probabilities are not necessarily equal. However, experimental probability will eventually approach theoretical probability as we conduct more and more trials. This phenomenon is called the Law of Large Numbers . This means if you flip a fair coin a small number of times , the experimental probability is likely to be different each time and could be very different from the theoretical probability. But if you flip a coin a large number of times , the experimental probability becomes very close to the theoretical probability of 50%. The Law of Large Numbers is extremely powerful in that it allows us to approximate the theoretical probability of complex events - like changes in beliefs and opinions, likelihood of natural disasters, climate change effects - through repeated sampling and simulation.    Probability of Compound Events  Now that we have the basics in place, let's look at some compound probability problems that we will be studying in this course.    And Probabilities  As we saw with truth tables, the event and refers to an event where both and occur. These events may occur at the same time or they could happen in a sequence such as and then . How we calculate the theoretical probability of the event and (or and then ) depends on whether the two events are independent or dependent.    Independent and Dependent Events  Two events and are independent if the probability of occurring is the same whether or not occurs. If the probability of is affected by the occurrence of , then we say that the events are dependent .  Coin flips and die rolls are common examples of independent events - flipping heads does not change the probability of flipping heads the next time, nor does rolling a six change the probability that the next roll will be a six.  Another type of event is a selection event, such as randomly selecting or drawing items from a bag, etc. These are also independent if we draw with replacement . By replacing the item, we reset the probability back to what it was before we made the selection. Since the probability of each subsequent selection is the same as the first selection, the events are independent.  If we draw without replacement , however, like selecting multiple people for a committee, we change the total number of possible outcomes, thereby changing the probability of subsequent selections. Therefore, if we draw without replacement, the events will be dependent .    Determine whether the following events are independent or dependent.   Flipping a fair coin twice and getting heads both times.    Selecting a president and then a vice president at random from a pool of five equally qualified individuals.    The event that it will rain in Portland tomorrow and the event that it will rain in Beaverton tomorrow.    Wearing your lucky socks and getting an A on your exam.          The probability of getting heads on the first flip is 0.5 or 50%. After flipping heads, the probability of getting heads on the second flip is still 0.5 or 50%. Since the probability of flipping heads on the second flip did not change because we flipped heads on the first flip, the events are independent .    Since two different people will be put in the role of president and vice president, we are drawing without replacement and the events are therefore dependent .    If it is raining in Portland it is more likely that it will rain in Beaverton, so the events are dependent .    Although there may some sort of placebo effect at play in terms of confidence and persistence, the socks you wear do not have a direct effect on how well you do on your exam, so these events are independent .       To calculate and probabilities we multiply, but we need to determine whether the events are independent or dependent. If they are independent, then we can multiply the individual probability of each event because one does not affect the other. If the events are dependent, then we need to multiply by the conditional probability based on what has previously happened. Here is a summary of this.   And  Probabilities If events A and B are independent, then   If events A and B are dependent, then    The probability of given is called a conditional probability since it depends, or is conditional, on occurring. We saw examples of conditional probability when we looked at contingency tables in the previous section.    Suppose you have a bag containing 6 red Legos, 4 green Legos, and 3 black Legos. We will make exactly two lego selections from the bag. What is the probability of selecting:   two red Legos in a row if we put the first red Lego back in the bag?    two red Legos in a row if we don't put the first Lego back in the bag?    a red Lego and then a green Lego if we do not put the red Lego back in the bag?          Since the outcomes are equally likely, the probability of selecting a red Lego is the number of red Legos divided by the total number of Legos, or .  If we replace the red Lego we selected (selections are independent), we go back to having 6 red Legos in the bag of 13 Legos total. Therefore,       If we do not replace the first red Lego (selections are dependent), then on our second draw there will only be 5 red Legos remaining, and 12 Legos in total. Therefore,       The probability of selecting a red Lego on the first draw is the same as in parts a and b. Since we are not putting the red Lego back into the bag, we will have only 12 Lego left in total, of which 4 are green. Therefore,          Let's look at an example where we repeat an event many times.    Suppose there is a 6% chance you will receive a citation if you ride the MAX train without a ticket. What is the probability that you get away without a single citation if you ride without purchasing a ticket for 20 days this month?    The first thing we want to recognize is that this question is essentially asking for the probability of no citation and no citation and no citation…. twenty times (one for each day you ride without buying a ticket). Since the outcomes are connected by an and , we know we will be multiplying the probabilities. In this case the the outcomes are independent (you are not more or less likely to get a citation if you already received a citation). Therefore,         Or Probabilities  The event or refers to an event that includes the outcomes of or or both . We have seen the inclusive or both in terms of sets and logic, and in terms of contingency tables. The way we calculate the probability of or depends on whether the events have characteristics that are overlapping or disjoint.    Overlapping or Disjoint Sets  Sets being disjoint means the same thing as not overlapping . If the sets in question are events (subsets of the sample space) and , then and being disjoint means that cannot happen when does, and vice versa. When events are disjoint, we may also call them mutually exclusive .   To apply this to probability, we will look at an example of events that have overlapping characteristics, such as color and shape.    A prize machine is filled with 10 yellow erasers, 6 green erasers, 4 red pencil sharpeners, 8 yellow pencil sharpeners, and 5 red bouncy balls. Each prize is inside a plastic sphere, and the spheres are well mixed in the prize machine. Each game will get you just one prize. Determine the probability of   getting a yellow prize.    getting a red or yellow prize.    getting a prize that is yellow or an eraser.          Since yellow is a single event, we just need to know how many prizes there are in total, and how many of the prizes are yellow. The yellow prizes include the 10 yellow erasers and the 8 yellow pencil sharpeners.       For a red or yellow prize, the set of red and the set of yellow do not overlap. They are disjoint sets, so we will add the probability of getting a red prize to the probability of getting a yellow prize.       To find the probability of getting a prize that is yellow or an eraser, we need to be careful because these are overlapping sets. There are two ways to calculate this, and it is a lot like what we did with contingency tables. The first way is to add all the items separately, being careful not to double count.     The second way is to count the total of yellow items and the total of erasers, but the yellow erasers are in both sets, or the overlap. We would be counting them twice and so we subtract their joint probability.          Here is a summary of how we found the or probabilities.   Or Probabilities  If the sets are disjoint,   If the sets are overlapping,    We could also use the overlapping formula as a general formula, because in the case of disjoint sets . Here is another example with overlapping events.    What is the probability of rolling two fair dice and getting a pair or a sum of 6?    For complicated events it's a good idea to list all of the outcomes. Here we list them in a table. Looking at the table of outcomes, we see that there are 36 in total. Six outcomes that are pairs lie along the upper-to-lower diagonal that goes through . There are 5 outcomes that add to 6 along the lower-to-upper diagonal line that also goes through . That outcome is both a pair and a sum of 6, so the events are overlapping.     1  2  3  4  5  6    1          2          3          4          5          6          As in the last example, there are two ways to do this.  If we add all of the pairs and sums of 6 without double counting, we get:     To use the subtraction method, we need to add the probability of rolling a pair to the probability of rolling a sum of 6 and subtract the overlap. Thus we have:     Now that we have looked at empirical and theoretical probability, we will be able to use them for something very important in the next section - expected value.

  "title": "Expected Value",
  "body": " Expected Value   Expected Value   Students will be able to:     Make a probability model    Calculate the expected value for a probability model    Determine whether a game is fair      Expected value is one of the useful probability concept we will discuss. It has many applications, from insurance policies to making financial decisions, and it's one thing that the casinos and government agencies that run gambling operations and lotteries may hope most people never learn about.   Alternative Video Lesson      Expected Value  The expected value is the average gain or loss of an event if the procedure is repeated many times. To help get a better understanding of what expected value is and how it is used, consider the following scenario:  You are commissioned to design a game for a local carnival. Your proposed game will have players roll a six-sided die. If it comes up 6, they win $10. If not, they get to roll again. If they get a 6 on the second roll, then they win 3. If they do not get a 6 on the second roll, they lose. With the game design complete, you now need to decide how much the carnival game owner should charge players in order to make a profit over the long run.  To make a profit, the carnival needs to know how much they will pay in winnings, on average, over the long run and charge more than that. In other words, they must charge more than the expected value of the game.  One way to organize the outcomes and probabilities is with a probability model. A probability model or probability distribution is a table listing the possible outcomes and their corresponding probabilities. The outcomes will be the amounts a player can win, and we will calculate the probabilities using what we have learned about theoretical probability.  As we have seen with complements, probabilities in a probability distribution must add to 1, so that is important to check. Here is the probability model for the carnival game:    Outcome ($ won)  Rolling Event  Probability    $10  Roll a 6 on the first roll     $3  Roll not a 6 on the first roll and a 6 on the second roll     $0  Roll not a 6 on the first roll and not a 6 on the second roll     Think of the expected value as a weighted average. We could take the average of $10, $3, and $0, but they are not all equally likely. It is much more likely to win $0 than to win $10. So, to find the average, we multiply each outcome by the chance it will happen and add the products together.   Expected Value  Multiply each outcome by its probability and add up the products   In this case we have:     This tells us that over the long run, players can expect to win $2.08 per game. This also means that the carnival owner will be paying out an average of $2.08 per game! Since the carnival owner would rather not lose money by paying players over the long run we need to make sure to charge players enough to offset the average payout.  If the carnival owner charges exactly $2.08 to play, the game is considered a fair game since the expected winnings would be $0. In a fair game, the player isn't expected to win anything, nor is the owner expected to earn anything over the long run. However, if the carnival owner charges the player more than $2.08 to play, they will earn money over the long run.  Suppose you suggest charging $5 to play. We can determine the net winnings by subtracting the $5 the player has to pay from their expected winnings. This gives us:     This means that over the long run, players can expect to lose an average of $2.92 each game they play, and the carnival owner can expect to earn an average of $2.92 per game over the long run. Here's another example.    Pick4 is a game by the Oregon Lottery that costs $1 to play. In this game you pick 4 numbers in a specific pattern. If you get the exact sequence, you can in theory earn a lot of money. Suppose that the payouts are as follows. Determine the player's expected net winnings.    Prize ($)  Probability    $250     $500     $1000     $1500       This table is not quite a complete probability distribution since it is missing one important outcome: when the player loses. In that case the prize is $0. We need to add a line for this. The prize for this missing outcome is $0, and since losing is the complement to winning something , the probability will be:      Adding this information to the table gives a complete probability distribution. Now we can see that players are going to lose more than 99% of the time, so the expected value will be heavily weighted toward winning $0.    Prize ($)  Probability    $250     $500     $1000     $1500     $0  0.9961       Therefore, the player's expected winnings are $2.07, on average, over the long run. To find the expected net winnings, we subtract the cost to play. Since it costs $1 to play,     Assuming the given payouts are correct, this would be one game you would want to play for investment purposes since you can expect to earn $1.07 per game, on average, over the long run. Play a million times, and you just might become a millionaire!    In general, if the expected value of a game is negative, it is not a good idea to play, since in the long run you will lose money. It would be better to play a game with a positive expected value (good luck trying to find one!), although keep in mind that even if the average winnings are positive it could be the case that most people lose money and one very fortunate individual wins a great deal of money.  Not surprisingly, the expected value for casino games is always negative for the player, and therefore positive for the casino. It must be positive for the casino, or they would go out of business! Players just need to keep in mind that when they play a game repeatedly, they should expect to lose money. That is fine so long as you enjoy playing the game and think it is worth the cost, but it would be wrong to expect to come out ahead.  Expected value is not only used to determine the average amount won and lost at casinos and carnivals, it also has applications in business and insurance, just to name a few. Let's look at a couple of those applications.    For 3 months, a coffee shop tracked their morning sales of coffee, between 6am and 10am. The following results were recorded:    Number of cups sold  145  150  155  160  170    Probability  0.15  0.22  0.37  0.19  0.07    How many cups of coffee should they expect to sell each morning?    In this case the table tells us that 15% of the time they sell 145 cups of coffee between 6am and 10am, 22% of the time they sell 150 cups, 37% of the time they sell 155 cups, 19% of the time they sell 160 cups, and 7% of the time they sell 170 cups. Since the highest probability is associated with 155 cups, the expected value should lie somewhat close to this.  To find the expected number of coffees sold, we multiply each number of cups of coffee by its respective probability and then add the products.       This means that over the long run, the coffee shop can expect, on average, to sell around 154 cups of coffee each morning. This is an important tool for businesses since it helps inform them how much stock they should keep on hand.      On average, a 40-year-old man in the US has a 0.242% chance of dying in the next year According to the estimator at . An insurance company charges $275 annually for a life insurance policy that pays a $100,000 death benefit. What is the expected value for the insurance company on this policy?    The first thing we want to do is organize the probabilities and outcomes in a probability distribution table. There are two outcomes – either the policy holder dies, and the insurance company pays the benefit, or the policy holder does not die, and they do not pay anything.  The probability of paying the death benefit is equal to the chance of the person dying in the next year, and the probability of paying nothing is equal to the complement of the chance of dying in the next year.    Insurance payout  Probability    $100000  0.00242    $0  1-0.00242=0.99758    Then we can calculate:     So, the expected payout for the insurance company is $242, but they are charging $275 for the policy. Their net revenue would be     The insurance company is making, on average, $33 per policy per year. It shouldn't be too surprising because there are overhead costs and the insurance company can only afford to offer policies if they, on average, make money on them. But how much money should they make? As a consumer it is important to know about expected value.      Exercises   A bag contains 3 gold marbles, 6 silver marbles, and 28 black marbles. Someone offers to play this game: You randomly select on marble from the bag. If it is gold, you win $3. If it is silver, you win $2. If it is black, you lose $1.     Make a probability model for this game.    What is your expected value if you play this game?           Die roll  Gold  Silver  Black    Outcome  $3  $2  -$1>    Probability            The expected value is approximately -$0.19. That is, you would lose about $0.19 on average each time you pick a marble.       A bag contains 5 red marbles, 8 blue marbles, and 15 green marbles. Someone offers to play this game: You randomly select one marble from the bag. If it is blue, you win $3. If it is red, you win $2. If it is green, you lose $1.

A company wants to offer a 2-year extended warranty in case their product fails after the original warranty period but within 2 years of the purchase. They estimate that 0.7% of their products will fail during that time, and it will cost them $350 to replace a failed product. If they charge $48 for the extended warranty, what is the company's expected profit or loss on each warranty sold?   The company's expected profit is $45.55 per warranty sold.    A company wants to offer a 3-year extended warranty in case their product fails after the original warranty period but within 3 years of the purchase. They estimate that 0.5% of their products will fail during that time, and it will cost them $400 to replace a failed product. If they charge $60 for the extended warranty, what is the company's expected profit or loss on each warranty sold?   The company's expected profit is $58 per warranty sold.    An insurance company estimates the probability of an earthquake in the next year to be 0.0013. The average damage done by an earthquake it estimates to be $60,000. If the company offers earthquake insurance for $100, what is their expected value of the policy?   The company's expected value on each policy is $22 which means they will make $22, on average, per policy sold.    An insurance company estimates the probability of a flood in the next year to be 0.0002. The average damage done by a flood is estimated to be $70,000. If the company offers flood insurance for $3000, what is their expected value of the policy?   The company's expected value on each policy is $2,986 which means they will make $2,986, on average, per policy sold.    You purchase a raffle ticket to help out a charity. The raffle ticket costs $5. The charity is selling 2000 tickets. One of them will be drawn and the person holding the ticket will be given a prize worth $4000. Compute the expected value for this raffle.   The expected value for this raffle is -$3.    You purchase a raffle ticket to help out a charity. The raffle ticket costs $10. The charity is selling 1000 tickets. One of them will be drawn and the person holding the ticket will be given a prize worth $3000. Compute the expected value for this raffle.   The expected value for this raffle is -$7.    At the local fair there is a game in which folks are betting where a chicken will poop on a 5 by 5-foot grid. (There are 25, 1 by 1 squares to choose from) You can buy a 1 by 1-foot square for $10 and if the chicken poops on your square you win $100. Find the expected value for this game.   The expected value for this game is approximately -$6.    At the local fair there is a game in which folks are betting where a chicken will poop on a 4 by 4-foot grid. (There are 16, 1 by 1 squares to choose from) You can buy a 1 by 1-foot square for $15 and if the chicken poops on your square you win $125. Find the expected value for this game.   The expected value for this game is approximately -$7.19.    Create a problem using the concept of expected value. Possible topics include insurance policies, financial decisions, gambling and lotteries. Determine the expected value of the situation you created.   Answers will vary since you are making up your own problem.    "

But if we cannot distinguish credible information from misleading information, then we are vulnerable to manipulation and making decisions that are not in our best interest. Statistics provides tools for us to evaluate information critically. In this sense, statistics is one of the most important things to know about.  Statistics are often presented to add credibility to an argument. To give some examples, here are some claims that we have heard on several occasions. (We are not saying that each one of these claims is true!)   4 out of 5 dentists recommend Dentyne.    Almost 85% of lung cancers in men and 45% in women are tobacco-related.    Condoms are effective 94% of the time.    People tend to be more persuasive when they look others directly in the eye and speak loudly and quickly.    Women make 75 cents to every dollar a man makes when they work the same job.    A surprising new study shows that eating egg whites can increase one's life span.    People predict that it is very unlikely there will ever be another baseball player with a batting average over 400.    There is an 80% chance that in a room full of 30 people that at least two people will share the same birthday.    79.48% of all statistics are made up on the spot.     All these claims are statistical in character. We suspect that some of them sound familiar; if not, you have probably heard other claims like them. Notice how diverse the examples are; they come from psychology, health, law, sports, business, etc. Data and data-interpretation show up in virtually every facet of contemporary life.  Many of these numbers do not represent careful statistical analysis. They can be misleading and push you into decisions that you might regret. This chapter will help you learn the skills to be a critical consumer of statistical claims.    Statistical Process  To give you an overview, here is a diagram of the steps taken in a poll or other statistical study, and the elements in each step that we will discuss in this chapter. We will use many examples to illustrate the whole process.    5 rectangles indicating the 5 steps of the statistical process; 1. Identify the group you want to study, which is the population; 2. Identify the quantity you want to know about the population, which is the parameter; 3. Gather data by taking an unbiased sample or performing an experiment; 4. Graph the data and calculate statistics; 5. Estimate the parameter that you wanted to know with the margin of error and confidence interval.      Population  Before we begin gathering any data to analyze, we need to identify the population we are studying. The population of a study is the group we want to know something about. The population could be people, auto parts or tomato plants.  If we want to know the amount of money spent on textbooks by a typical college student, our population might be all students at Portland Community College. Or it might be:   All community college students in the state of Oregon.    All students at public colleges and universities in the state of Oregon.    All students at all colleges and universities in the state of Oregon.    All students at all colleges and universities in the entire United States.    And so on.     The intended population is also called the target population , since if we design our study badly, the collected data might not actually be representative of the intended population.    A newspaper website contains a poll asking people their opinion on a recent news article. What is the population?    While the target (intended) population may have been all people, the real population of the survey is readers of the website.      Parameter  A parameter is the value (percentage, average, etc.) that we are interested in for the whole population. Since it is often too time-consuming, expensive and\/or impossible to get data for the entire population, the parameter is usually a theoretical quantity that we are trying to estimate. For example, the typical amount of money spent per year on textbooks by students at your college in a year is a parameter.    Sample  To estimate the parameter, we select a sample , which is a smaller subset of the entire population. It is very important that we choose a representative sample , one that matches the characteristics of the population, to have a good estimate. If we survey 100 students at your college, those students would be our sample. We will talk about how to choose a representative sample later in this section.    Statistic  To get our data , we would then ask each student in the sample how much they spent on textbooks and record the answers, or raw data . Then we could calculate the average, which is our statistic. A statistic is a value (percentage, average, etc.) calculated using data from a sample.    A researcher wants to know how the citizens of Portland feel about a voter initiative. To study this, they go downtown to the Pioneer Place Mall and survey 500 shoppers. Sixty percent indicate they are supportive of the initiative. Identify the population, parameter, sample and statistic.     Population : While the intended population of this survey is Portland citizens, the effective population is Pioneer Place Mall shoppers. There is no reason to assume that shoppers at this mall would be representative of all Portland citizens.   Parameter : The parameter is what we want to know about the population, the percentage of Portland citizens that support the initiative.   Sample : The sample is the subgroup of the population selected. The 500 shoppers questioned make up the sample, which, again, is probably not representative of the population.   Statistic : The statistic is calculated using the data from the sample. The percentage of people sampled who support the initiative is 60%.      Sampling  As we mentioned in a previous section, the first thing we should do before conducting a survey is to identify the population that we want to study. Suppose we are hired by a politician to determine the amount of support they have among the electorate should they decide to run for another term. What population should we study? Every person in the district? Eligible voters might be better, but what if they don't register? Registered voters may not vote. What about likely voters?   This is the criteria used in a lot of political polling, but it is sometimes difficult to define a likely voter.  Here is an example of the challenges of political polling.   In November 1998, former professional wrestler Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura was elected governor of Minnesota. Up until right before the election, most polls showed he had little chance of winning. There were several contributing factors to the polls not reflecting the actual intent of the electorate:   Ventura was running on a third-party ticket and most polling methods are better suited to a two-candidate race.    Many respondents to polls may have been embarrassed to tell pollsters that they were planning to vote for a professional wrestler.    The mere fact that the polls showed Ventura had little chance of winning might have prompted some people to vote for him in protest to send a message to the major-party candidates.     But one of the major contributing factors was that Ventura recruited a substantial amount of support from young people, particularly college students, who had never voted before and who registered specifically to vote in that election. The polls did not deem these young people likely voters (since in most cases young people have a lower rate of voter registration and a lower turnout rate for elections) so the polling samples were subject to sampling bias : they omitted a portion of the electorate that was weighted in favor of the winning candidate.   So, identifying the population can be a difficult job, but once we have identified the population, how do we choose a good sample? We want our statistic to estimate the parameter we are interested in, so we need to have a representative sample. Returning to our hypothetical job as a political pollster, we would not anticipate very accurate results if we drew all of our samples from customers at a Starbucks, or your list of TikTok followers. How do we get a sample that resembles our population?    Sampling Methods  One way to get a representative sample is to use randomness. We will look at three types of sampling that use randomness and one that does not.    Simple random sample (SRS)  A simple random sample , abbreviated SRS, is one in which every member of the population has an equal probability of being chosen.   If we could somehow identify all likely voters in the state, put each of their names on a piece of paper, toss the slips into a (very large) hat and draw 1000 slips out of the hat, we would have a simple random sample.   In practice, computers are better suited for this sort of endeavor. It is always possible, however, that even a random sample might end up not being totally representative of the population. If we repeatedly take samples of 1000 people from among the population of likely voters in the state of Oregon, some of these samples might tend to have a slightly higher percentage of Democrats (or Republicans) than the general population; some samples might include more older people and some samples might include more younger people; etc. This is called sampling variation . If there are certain groups that we want to make sure are represented, we might instead use a stratified sample.    Stratified sampling  In stratified sampling , a population is divided into a number of subgroups (or strata). Random samples are then taken from each subgroup. It is often desirable to make the sample sizes proportional to the size of each subgroup in the population.   Suppose that data from voter registrations in the state indicated that the electorate was comprised of 39% Democrats, 37% Republicans and 24% Independents. In a sample of 1000 people, they would then expect to get about 390 Democrats, 370 Republicans and 240 Independents. To accomplish this, they could randomly select 390 people from among those voters known to be Democrats, 370 from those known to be Republicans, and 240 from those with no party affiliation.   A way to remember stratified sampling is think about having a piece of layer cake. Each layer represents a stratum or subgroup, and a slice of the cake represents a sample of each layer.    Systematic sampling  In systematic sampling , every member of the population is selected to be in the sample. The starting position is often chosen at random.   To select a systematic sample, Portland Community College could use their database to select a random student from the first 100 student ID numbers. Then they would select every 100th student ID number after that. Systematic sampling is not as random as a simple random sample (if your ID number is right next to your friend's because you applied at the same time, you could not both end up in the same sample) but it can yield acceptable samples. This method can be useful for people waiting in lines, parts on a manufacturing line, or plants in a row.     Convenience sampling   Convenience sampling is when samples are chosen by selecting whomever is convenient. This is the worst type of sampling because it does not use randomness.   A pollster stands on a street corner and interviews the first 100 people who agree to speak to them. This is a convenience sample.     Statistical Bias  There is no way to correct for biased data, so it is very important to think through the entire study and data analysis before we start. We talked about sampling or selection bias , which is when the sample is not representative of the population. One example of this is voluntary response bias , which is bias introduced by only collecting data from those who volunteer to participate. This can lead to bias if the people who volunteer have different characteristics than the general population. Here is a summary of some additional sources of bias.    Types of bias   Sampling bias – when the sample is not representative of the population   Voluntary response bias – the sampling bias that often occurs when the sample is made up of volunteers   Self-interest study – bias that can occur when the researchers have an interest in the outcome   Response bias – when the responder gives inaccurate responses for any reason   Perceived lack of anonymity – when the responder fears giving an honest answer might negatively affect them   Loaded questions – when the question wording influences the responses   Non-response bias – when people refuse to participate in a study or drop out of an experiment, we can no longer be certain that our sample is representative of the population  Sources of bias may be conscious or unconscious. They may be innocent or as intentional as pressuring by a pollster. Here are some examples of the types of bias.      Consider a recent study which found that chewing gum may raise math grades in teenagers Reuters. . Retrieved 4\/27\/09 . This study was conducted by the Wrigley Science Institute, a branch of the Wrigley chewing gum company. This is an example of a self-interest study; one in which the researches have a vested interest in the outcome of the study. While this does not necessarily mean the study was biased, we should subject the study to extra scrutiny.    Consider online reviews of products and businesses. Customers tend to leave reviews if they are very satisfied or very dissatisfied. While you can look for overall patterns and get useful information, these reviews suffer from voluntary response bias and likely capture more extreme views than the general population.    A survey asks participants a question about their interactions with people of different ethnicities. This study could suffer from response bias. A respondent might give an untruthful answer to not be perceived as racist.    An employer puts out a survey asking their employees if they have a drug abuse problem and need treatment help. Here, answering truthfully might have serious consequences; responses might not be accurate if there is a perceived lack of anonymity and employees fear retribution.    A survey asks, “Do you support funding research on alternative energy sources to reduce our reliance on high-polluting fossil fuels?” This is an example of a loaded or leading question – questions whose wording leads the respondent towards a certain answer.    A poll was conducted by phone with the question, “Do you often have time to relax and read a book?” Fifty percent of the people who were called refused to participate in the survey (Probably because they didn't have the time). It is unlikely that the results will be representative of the entire population. This is an example of non-response bias.      Loaded questions can occur intentionally by pollsters with an agenda, or accidentally through poor question wording. Also of concern is question order, where the order of questions changes the results. Here is an example from a psychology researcher Swartz, Norbert. Retrieved 3\/31\/2009 :    My favorite finding is this: we did a study where we asked students, 'How satisfied are you with your life? How often do you have a date?' The two answers were not statistically related - you would conclude that there is no relationship between dating frequency and life satisfaction. But when we reversed the order and asked, 'How often do you have a date? How satisfied are you with your life?' the statistical relationship was a strong one. You would now conclude that there is nothing as important in a student's life as dating frequency.      Observational Studies  So far, we have primarily discussed surveys and polls, which are types of observational studies – studies based on observations or measurements. These observations may be solicited, like in a survey or poll. Or, they may be unsolicited, such as studying the percentage of cars that turn right at a red light even when there is a no turn on red sign.    Experiments  In contrast, it is common to use experiments when exploring how subjects react to an outside influence. In an experiment, some kind of treatment is applied to the subjects and the results are measured and recorded. When conducting experiments, it is essential to isolate the treatment being tested. Here are some examples of treatments.      A pharmaceutical company tests a new medicine for treating Alzheimer's disease by administering the drug to 50 elderly patients with recent diagnoses. The treatment here is the new drug.    A gym tests out a new weight loss program by enlisting 30 volunteers to try out the program. The treatment here is the new program.    A psychology researcher explores the effect of music on affect by measuring people's mood while listening to different types of music. The music is the treatment.    Suppose a middle school finds that their students are not scoring well on the state's standardized math test. They decide to run an experiment to see if a new curriculum would improve scores. To run the test, they hire a math specialist to come in and teach a class using the new curriculum. To their delight, they see an improvement in test scores.  The difficulty with the last scenario is that it is not clear whether the new curriculum or the math specialist is responsible for the improvement. This is called confounding and it is the downfall of many experiments, though it is often hidden.        Confounding   Confounding occurs when there are two or more potential variables that could have caused the outcome and it is not possible to determine which one actually caused the result.      A drug company study about a weight loss pill might report that people lost an average of 8 pounds while using their new drug. However, in the fine print you find a statement saying that participants were encouraged to also diet and exercise. It is not clear in this case whether the weight loss is due to the pill, to diet and exercise, or a combination of both. In this case confounding has occurred.    Researchers conduct an experiment to determine whether students will perform better on an arithmetic test if they listen to music during the test. They first give the student a test without music, then give a similar test while the student listens to music. In this case, the student might perform better on the second test, regardless of the music, simply because it was the second test and they were warmed up.      There are a number of measures that can be introduced to help reduce the likelihood of confounding. The primary measure is to use a control group.    Control group  In experiments, the participants are typically divided into a treatment group and a control group. The treatment group receives the treatment being tested; the control group does not receive the treatment.  Ideally, the groups are otherwise as similar as possible, isolating the treatment as the only potential source of difference between the groups. For this reason, the method of dividing groups is important. Some researchers attempt to ensure that the groups have similar characteristics (same number of each gender identity, same number of people over 50, etc.), but it is nearly impossible to control for every characteristic. Because of this, random assignment is very commonly used.      To determine if a two-day prep course would help high school students improve their scores on the SAT test, a group of students was randomly divided into two subgroups. The first group, the treatment group, was given a two-day prep course. The second group, the control group, was not given the prep course. Afterwards, both groups took the SAT test.    A company testing a new plant food grows two crops of plants in adjacent fields that typically produce the same amount of food. The treatment group receives the new plant food and the control group does not. The crop yields would then be compared. By growing the two crops at the same time in similar fields, they are controlling for weather and other confounding factors.      Sometimes not giving the control group anything does not completely control for confounding variables. For example, suppose a medicine study is testing a new headache pill by giving the treatment group the pill and the control group nothing. If the treatment group showed improvement, we would not know whether it was due to the medicine, or a response to have something. This is called a placebo effect.    Placebo effect  The placebo effect is when the effectiveness of a treatment is influenced by the patient's perception of how effective they think the treatment will be, so a result might be seen even if the treatment is ineffectual.   A study found that when doing painful dental tooth extractions, patients told they were receiving a strong painkiller while actually receiving a saltwater injection found as much pain relief as patients receiving a dose of morphine. Levine JD, Gordon NC, Smith R, Fields HL. (1981) Analgesic responses to morphine and placebo in individuals with postoperative pain. Pain. 10:379-89.    To control for the placebo effect, a placebo , or dummy treatment, is often given to the control group. This way, both groups are truly identical except for the specific treatment given.    Placebo and Placebo-controlled experiments  An experiment that gives the control group a placebo is called a placebo-controlled experiment.      In a study for a new medicine that is dispensed in a pill form, a sugar pill could be used as a placebo.    In a study on the effect of alcohol on memory, a non-alcoholic beer might be given to the control group as a placebo.    In a study of a frozen meal diet plan, the treatment group would receive the diet food, and the control group could be given standard frozen meals taken out of their original packaging.      In some cases, it is more appropriate to compare to a conventional treatment than a placebo. For example, in a cancer research study, it would not be ethical to deny any treatment to the control group or to give a placebo treatment. In this case, the currently acceptable medicine would be given to the second group, called a comparison group . In our SAT test example, the non-treatment group would most likely be encouraged to study on their own, rather than be asked to not study at all, to provide a meaningful comparison. It is very important to consider the ethical ramifications of any experiment.    Blind studies  A blind study is one that uses a placebo and the participants do not know whether they are receiving the treatment or a placebo. A double-blind study is one in which the subjects and those interacting with them don't know who is in the treatment group and who is in the control group.   In a study about anti-depression medication, you would not want the psychological evaluator to know whether a patient is in the treatment or control group, as it might influence their evaluation. The experiment should be conducted as a double-blind study.     Margin of Error and Confidence Intervals  Even when a study or experiment has successfully avoided bias and has been well done, there is still an element of variation. If we took 5 different random samples of 100 college students and calculated their average textbook cost, we wouldn't expect to get the exact same average for each sample. This is due to sampling variation. To account for this, researchers publish their margin of error or a confidence interval for their statistics. These numbers describe the precision of the estimate for a certain confidence level.  You've probably heard something like, The candidate has 54 percent of the likely voters, plus or minus three percent. The 3% is called the margin of error , so the true percentage is somewhere between 51% and 57%, with a certain level of confidence. To write this as a confidence interval , we place the numbers in parentheses from smallest to largest, separated by a comma: (51%, 57%).  The most common confidence level is 95%, which means if the poll was conducted repeatedly, and we made a confidence interval each time, we would expect the true percentage, or parameter, to fall within our confidence interval 95 out of 100 times. You can learn more on how to calculate the margin of error for different confidence levels in a statistics class.    Let's say we asked a random sample of 100 students at Portland Community College and found that they spent an average of $451.32 on books their first year, plus or minus $85.63. Write this as a confidence interval, assuming a 95% confidence level.    If the margin of error was calculated to be plus or minus $85.63, then with a confidence level of 95% we could say that the average amount spent by the population is somewhere between $365.69 and $536.95.  These values are found by computing and   We could also write this as a confidence interval : ($365.69, $536.95).  Now we have come full circle and seen how we can use data from a sample to estimate the parameter we were interested in for our population.      Exercises   Describe the difference between a sample and a population.   A sample is a sub group of the population. A population is the entire group of subjects.    Describe the difference between a statistic and a parameter.   A Statistic is a measurement obtained from the data taken from a sample. A parameter is a measurement obtained from the data of the entire population.    The ASPCC randomly selects 200 students from PCC Cascade campus to participate in a childcare survey in order to determine the demand for additional childcare options for PCC students.   Who is the intended population?    What is the sample?    Is the collected data representative of the intended population? Why or why not?      The intended population is all PCC students.   All PCC Students    200 students from PCC Cascade campus    The collected data is not representative of all PCC students since it only includes responses from students at Cascade campus. This is an example of sampling bias.       A local research firm randomly selects 1200 homes in Washington County to determine support for adding compost pick up to residents' regular garbage service.   Who is the intended population?    What is the sample?    Is the collected data representative of the intended population? Why or why not?         The intended population is all Washington County residences.    1200 homes in Washington County    The collected data is likely representative since residences were selected at random from the entire county.       A political scientist surveys 28 of the current 106 representatives in a state's congress. Of them, 14 said they were supporting a new education bill, 12 said there were not supporting the bill, and 2 were undecided.     Who is the population of this survey?    What is the size of the population?    What is the size of the sample?    Give the statistic for the percentage of representatives surveyed who said they were supporting the education bill.    If the margin of error was 5%, give the confidence interval for the percentage of representatives we might we expect to support the education bill and explain what the confidence interval tells us.

The population size is     The sample size is in     The statistic is or 50%    The confidence interval is and tells us that the true percentage of the state congress representatives in support of the new education (the parameter) likely lies between 45% and 55%.

Who is the population of this survey?    What is the size of the population?    What is the size of the sample?    Give the statistic for the percentage of voters surveyed who said they'd vote for Brown.    If the margin of error was 3.5%, give the confidence interval for the percentage of voters surveyed that we might we expect to vote for Brown and explain what the confidence interval tells us.         All registered voters in the city of Raleigh.    The population size is     The sample size is     The statistic is or 32%    The confidence interval is and tells us that the true percentage of registered voters who will vote for Brown is likely to lie between 28.5% and 35.5%.

To test a new lie detector, two groups of subjects are given the new test. One group is asked to answer all the questions truthfully. The second group is asked to tell the truth on the first half of the questions and lie on the second half. The person administering the lie detector test does not know what group each subject is in. Does this experiment have a control group? Is it blind, double-blind, or neither? Explain.   The control group would be the group that were ask to tell the truth. It is a blind study because the person who is administering the lie detector test doesn't know which group each person is in.    A poll found that 30%, plus or minus 5% of college freshmen prefer morning classes to afternoon classes.     What is the margin of error?    Write the survey results as a confidence interval.    Explain what the confidence interval tells us about the percentage of college freshmen who prefer morning classes?         0.05 or 5%    (25%, 35%)    I am confident that the percentage of college freshmen who prefer morning classes is between 25% to 35%.       A poll found that 38% of U.S. employees are engaged at work, plus or minus 3.5%.     What is the margin of error?    Write the survey results as a confidence interval.    Explain what the confidence interval tells us about the percentage of U.S. employees who are engaged at work?         3.5% or 0.035    (34.5%, 41.5%)    I am confident that the percentage of all U.S. Employees are engaged at work is between 34.5% and 41.5%.       A recent study reported a confidence interval of (24%, 36%) for the percentage of U.S. adults who plan to purchase an electric car in the next 5 years.   What is the statistic from this study?    What is the margin of error?          . The statistic is 30%.     . The margin of error is 6%.       A recent study reported a confidence interval of (44%, 52%) for the percentage of two-year college students who are food insecure.   What is the statistic from this study?    What is the margin of error?          . The statistic is 48%.     . The margin of error is 4%.       A farmer believes that playing Barry Manilow songs to his peas will increase their yield. Describe a controlled experiment the farmer could use to test his theory.   Play Barry Manilow to half the crop and don't play any music to the other half of the crop.    A sports psychologist believes that people are more likely to be extroverted as an adult if they played team sports as a child. Describe two possible studies to test this theory. Design one as an observational study and the other as an experiment. Which is more practical?   Answer will vary. Here is one potential solution.  Observational: Survey adults who played sports as a child. Ask them if they consider themselves extroverted or introverted. Record the percentage of each personality type.  Experimental: Survey adults and ask them if they played sports as children. Ask them if they consider themselves extroverted or introverted. Compare the results of adults who played sports as children with the adults who didn't play sports as children.  Which is more practical? The Experimental study would allow you to see if there is a significant difference in the personality types based on if the person played sports or didn't play sports.    Find a newspaper or magazine article, or the online equivalent, describing the results of a recent study (not a simple poll). Give a summary of the study's findings, then analyze whether the article provided enough information to determine the validity of the conclusions. If not, produce a list of things that are missing from the article that would help you determine the validity of the study. Look for the things discussed in the text: population, sample, randomness, blind, control, margin of error, etc.   Answers will vary depending on the article.    Use a polling website such as or and search for a poll that interests you. Find the result, the margin of error and confidence level for the poll and write the confidence interval.   Answers will vary depending on the poll being studied.    "

  "body": " In November 1998, former professional wrestler Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura was elected governor of Minnesota. Up until right before the election, most polls showed he had little chance of winning. There were several contributing factors to the polls not reflecting the actual intent of the electorate:   Ventura was running on a third-party ticket and most polling methods are better suited to a two-candidate race.    Many respondents to polls may have been embarrassed to tell pollsters that they were planning to vote for a professional wrestler.    The mere fact that the polls showed Ventura had little chance of winning might have prompted some people to vote for him in protest to send a message to the major-party candidates.     But one of the major contributing factors was that Ventura recruited a substantial amount of support from young people, particularly college students, who had never voted before and who registered specifically to vote in that election. The polls did not deem these young people likely voters (since in most cases young people have a lower rate of voter registration and a lower turnout rate for elections) so the polling samples were subject to sampling bias : they omitted a portion of the electorate that was weighted in favor of the winning candidate.

This study was conducted by the Wrigley Science Institute, a branch of the Wrigley chewing gum company. This is an example of a self-interest study; one in which the researches have a vested interest in the outcome of the study. While this does not necessarily mean the study was biased, we should subject the study to extra scrutiny.    Consider online reviews of products and businesses. Customers tend to leave reviews if they are very satisfied or very dissatisfied. While you can look for overall patterns and get useful information, these reviews suffer from voluntary response bias and likely capture more extreme views than the general population.    A survey asks participants a question about their interactions with people of different ethnicities. This study could suffer from response bias. A respondent might give an untruthful answer to not be perceived as racist.    An employer puts out a survey asking their employees if they have a drug abuse problem and need treatment help. Here, answering truthfully might have serious consequences; responses might not be accurate if there is a perceived lack of anonymity and employees fear retribution.    A survey asks, “Do you support funding research on alternative energy sources to reduce our reliance on high-polluting fossil fuels?” This is an example of a loaded or leading question – questions whose wording leads the respondent towards a certain answer.    A poll was conducted by phone with the question, “Do you often have time to relax and read a book?” Fifty percent of the people who were called refused to participate in the survey (Probably because they didn't have the time). It is unlikely that the results will be representative of the entire population. This is an example of non-response bias.     "

  "body": " Describing Data   Describing Data   Students will be able to:     Define and identify categorical and quantitative data    Read and construct frequency tables and relative frequency tables    Make bar charts and pie charts for categorical variables by hand and\/or using technology    Identify elements of misleading graphs: 3-dimensional graphs, perceptual distortion, misleading scales, stacked bar graphs    Make histograms for quantitative variables by hand and\/or using technology    Identify the number of modes in a distribution and whether it is symmetric, skewed to the left, or skewed to the right      Once we have collected data from an observational study or an experiment, we need to summarize and present it in a way that will be meaningful to our audience. The raw data is not very useful by itself. In this section we will begin with graphical presentations of data and in the rest of the chapter we will learn about numerical summaries of data.   Alternative Video Lessons      Types of Data  There are two types of data, categorical data and quantitative data. The word data is plural because it represents many pieces of information.   Categorical (qualitative) data are pieces of information that allow us to classify the subjects into various categories.   We might conduct a survey to determine the name of the favorite movie that people saw in a movie theater. When we conduct such a survey, the responses would look like: Finding Nemo, Black Panther, Titanic, etc.   We can count the number of people who give each answer, but the answers themselves do not have any numerical values: we cannot perform computations with an answer like Black Panther because it is categorical data.    Quantitative data are responses that are numerical in nature and with which we can perform meaningful calculations.   A survey could ask the number of movies you have seen in a movie theater in the past 12 months (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...). This would be quantitative data.   Other examples of quantitative data would be the running time of the movie you saw most recently (104 minutes, 137 minutes, 110 minutes, etc.) or the amount of money you paid for a movie ticket the last time you went to a movie theater ($5.50, $9.75, $10.50, etc.).  We cannot assume that all numbers are quantitative data, and sometimes it is not so clear-cut. Here are some examples to illustrate this.      Suppose we gather respondents' ZIP codes in a survey to track their geographical location. ZIP codes are numbers, but we can't do any meaningful calculations with them (it doesn't make sense to say that 98036 is \"twice\" 49018 — that's like saying that Lynnwood, WA is \"twice\" Battle Creek, MI, which doesn't make sense at all), so ZIP codes are really categorical data.    A survey about the movie you most recently saw includes the question, \"How would you rate the movie?\" with these possible answers:   It was awful.    It was just okay.    I liked it.    It was great.    Best movie ever!        Again, there are numbers associated with the responses, but these are really categories. A movie that rates a 4 is not necessarily twice as good as a movie that rates a 2, whatever that means; However, we often see that a movie got an average of 3.7 stars, which is an average of categorical ratings and it can give us important information.   Overall, it is important to look at the purpose of the study for any variables that could be classified as either categorical or quantitative. Another consideration is what you plan to do with the data. Next, we will talk about how to display each type of data.    Presenting Categorical Data  Since we can't do calculations with categorical data, we begin by summarizing the data in a frequency table or a relative frequency table.    Frequency Tables  A frequency table has one column for the categories, and another for the frequency , or number of times that category occurred.   An insurance company determines vehicle insurance premiums based on known risk factors. If a person is considered a higher risk, their premiums will be higher. One potential factor is the color of your car. The insurance company believes that people with some color cars are more likely to get in accidents. To research this, they examine police reports for recent total-loss collisions. The data is summarized in this table.    Car Color  Frequency of Total- Loss Collisions    Blue  25    Green  52    Red  41    White  36    Black  39    Grey  23    Total  216       Relative Frequency Tables  Counts are usually not as easy to interpret as percentages, so we will add a column for the relative frequencies. A relative frequency is the percentage for the category, found by dividing each frequency by the total and converting to a percentage. You'll notice the percentages may not add up to exactly 100% due to rounding.     Car Color  Frequency of Total- Loss Collisions  Relative Frequency of Total-Loss Collisions    Blue  25  or 11.6%    Green  52  or 24.1%    Red  41  or 19.0%    White  36  or 16.7%    Black  39  or 18.1%    Grey  23  or 10.7%    Total  216  or 100%    It would be even more useful to have a visual to see what is going on, and this is where charts and graphs come in. For categorical data we can display our data using bar graphs and pie charts.     Bar graphs  A bar graph is a graph that displays a bar for each category with the height of the bar indicating the frequency of that category. To construct a bar graph with vertical bars, we label the horizontal axis with the categories. The vertical axis will have a scale for the frequency or relative frequency.   The highest frequency in our car data is 52 collisions, so we will set our vertical axis to go from 0 to 55, with a scale of 5 units. To draw bar graphs by hand graph paper is useful, or you can use technology. It is also very helpful to label each bar with the frequency or relative frequency.   This is a bar graph. Along the x-axis it lists: blue, green, red, white, black and grey. The x-axis is labeled “Vehicle color involved in total-loss collision.” The y-axis is labeled “frequency” and goes from 0 to 55 with a scale of 5. Above each color there is a bar corresponding to the frequency. Blue 25; Green 52; Red 41; White 36; Black 39; Grey 23.      Pie Charts  A natural way to visualize relative frequencies is with a pie chart. A pie chart is a circle with wedges cut of varying sizes like slices of pizza or pie. The size of each wedge corresponds to the relative frequency of the category. The slices add up to 100%, just like relative frequencies. Pie charts can often benefit from including frequencies or relative frequencies in the pie slices.   Pie charts look nice but are harder to draw by hand than bar charts since to draw them accurately we would need to compute the angle each wedge cuts out of the circle, then measure the angle with a protractor. A spreadsheet is much better suited to drawing pie charts.   A pie chart for the same data as the previous bar chart. The relative frequencies are given in each pie piece: Green 24%; Red 19%; Black 18%; White 17%; Blue 11%; Grey 11%.      Using a Spreadsheet to Make Bar Charts and Pie Charts  To make a graph using a spreadsheet, place the data from the frequency table into the cells. Then select the data, go to the Insert tab, and choose the bar graph or pie chart that you would like. For this example, we will choose a pie graph.    This is a screen shot of excel that includes both the data and the Insert tab with various circle graph options.    After the spreadsheet has created your pie graph you can choose which design you prefer by clicking on the Chart Design tab. Since these pie pieces represent car colors, we matched the color of each wedge to the color of the car in our pie chart above.  To give your graph a meaningful title, click on Chart Title. There are many other settings that you can experiment with.    This is a screenshots of excel that shows the frequency table and pie chart and shows the Chart Design Tab.      Misleading Graphs  Graphs can be misleading intentionally or unintentionally. It's better to keep them simple, clear and well-labeled. People sometimes add features to graphs that don't help convey their information.    A 3-dimensional bar chart like the one shown is usually not as effective as a 2-dimensional graph. The extra dimension does not add any useful information.   A 3-D bar graph showing the car color data.    Here is another way that fanciness can sometimes lead to trouble. Instead of plain bars, it is tempting to substitute images. This type of graph is called a pictogram.     Perceptual Distortion  A pictogram is a statistical graphic in which the size of the picture is intended to represent the frequency or size of the values being represented. We need to be careful with these, because our brains perceive the relationship between the areas, not the heights.   A labor union might produce this graph to show the difference between the average manager salary and the average worker salary.   The average manager salary is twice as high as the average worker salary as in a bar graph, but the image is also twice as wide. That makes it look like the manager salary is 4 times as large as the worker salary. The area needs to accurately portray the relationship, otherwise we will have a perceptual distortion.   There are two bags of money shown. One is larger labeled Mananger Salaries. The other is half as tall and half as wide and labeled workers salaries. There are no numbers or scale shown.       Misleading Scale  Another type of distortion in bar charts results from setting the baseline to a value other than zero. The baseline is the bottom of the vertical axis, representing the least number of cases that could have occurred in a category. Normally, this number should be zero.   Compare the two graphs below showing support for same-sex marriage rights from a poll taken in December, 2008 CNN\/Opinion Research Corporation Poll. Dec 19-21, 2008, from . At a glance, the two graphs suggest very different stories. The second graph makes it look like more than three times as many people oppose marriage rights as support them. But when we look at the scale we can see that the difference is about 12%. By not starting at zero the difference looks enlarged.    A bar graph with a scale from 0-100%; There is a bar for support at about 44% and a bar for oppose at about 56%.    A bar graph of the same data but the scale goes from 40-60%; This magnifies the difference between the support and oppose groups.       Stacked Bar Graphs  Another type of graph that can be hard to read and sometimes misleading is a stacked bar graph. In a stacked bar graph , the values we are comparing are stacked on top of each other vertically.   The table lists college expenses for two different students and we want to compare them. A stacked bar graph shows the expenses stacked vertically, but we are interested in the differences, not the totals.    Expense  Student 1  Student 2    Rent  $500  $650    Food  $125  $125    Tuition  $1750  $1450    Books  $325  $275    Misc  $100  $175      A stacked bar graph with the bars for the expenses for student 2 placed on top of the bars for student 1.    A side-by-side bar graph with the bars for each student right next to each other.    It is much easier to interpret the differences in a side-by-side bar chart.     Presenting Quantitative Data  With categorical data, the horizontal axis is the category, but with quantitative, or numerical, data we have numbers. If we have repeated values we can also make a frequency table.   A teacher records scores on a 20-point quiz for the 30 students in their class. The scores in points are:     19  20  18  18  17  18  19  17  20  18  20  16  20  15  17    12  18  19  18  19  17  20  18  16  15  18  20  5  0  0     Here is a frequency table with the scores grouped and put in order.    Quiz Score  Frequency of Students    0  2    5  1    12  1    15  2    16  2    17  4    18  8    19  4    20  6     Using this table, it would be possible to create a standard bar chart from this summary, like we did for categorical data. However, since the scores are numerical values, this chart wouldn't make sense; the first and second bars would be five values apart, while the later bars would only be one value apart. Instead, we will treat the horizontal axis as a number line. This type of graph is called a histogram.    Histograms  A histogram is like a bar graph, but the horizontal axis is a number line. Unlike a bar graph, there are no spaces between the bars. Here are two histograms for the data given above. Notice that in the one on the left, the two scores of 15 are to the right of 15, or between 15 and 16. The horizontal scales on histograms can be confusing for this reason. Some people choose to have bars start at ½ values to avoid this ambiguity, as in the one on the right.    This is a histogram the x-axis is labeled score and goes from 0 to 21, with a scale of 1. The y-axis is labeled frequency an goes from 0 to 9 with a scale of 1. There are no spaces between the bars.    This is a histogram of the same data but this time the spaces are labeled 0 to 20 instead of the tick marks.    If we have a large number of different data values, a frequency table listing every possible value would be way too long. There would be too many bars on the histogram to reveal any patterns. For this reason, it is common with quantitative data to group data into class intervals.    Class Intervals   Class intervals are groupings of the data. In general, we define class intervals so that:   Each interval is equal in size. For example, if the first class contains values from 120 up to but not including 135, the second class should include values from 135 up to but not including 150.    We typically have somewhere between 5 and 20 classes, depending on the number of data values we're working with.     In the next example, we'll make a histogram using class intervals.   Suppose we have collected weights from 100 subjects who identify as male, as part of a nutrition study. For our weight data, we have values ranging from a low of 121 pounds to a high of 263 pounds, giving a total span of .  There are many ways to draw a histogram and we will explain one way as an example. We will create 10 classes by doing the following calculation: Take the range of 142 and divide it by 10 to find the class width.     Then we round up the class width so that the largest data value will be in one of the classes. So we round up to a class width of 15. Since the minimum data value is 121, we will choose 120 to start with since it is a multiple of 15 that is less than 121.     Interval  Frequency    120-134.99  4    135-149.99  14    150-164.99  16    165-179.99  28    180-194.99  12    195-209.99  8    210-224.99  7    225-239.99  6    240-254.99  2    255-269.99  3     This is a histogram of the data in the table; the x-axis is labeled weights(pounds) and goes from 120 to 270, with a scale of 15; The y-axis is labeled frequency and goes from 0 to 30 with a scale of 5. There are no spaces between the bars.     When using class intervals, it is much easier to use technology that was specifically designed to make histograms. GeoGebra is one program that lets you adjust the class widths to see which graph best displays the data.    Histograms Using Technology  We will be using GeoGebra throughout this chapter to make graphs and calculate summary statistics. There is an online version and one you can download at . To access the online version, select \"GeoGebra Classic from the GeoGebra home page. To download it, select \"App Downloads\" from the home page. The instructions are similar for both.   The first thing we need to do is enter the data in GeoGebra's spreadsheet. You can access the spreadsheet from Main Menu View Spreadsheet. Next, enter your data and select that column. Then click on the histogram icon in the menu bar on the left side and select One Variable Analysis.   A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the icon for One Variable Analysis     A new window will pop up showing a visual of the data. There is a drop-down menu for the type of graph, but histogram is the default. Notice that the bars are not lined up with the tick-marks at the bottom, so we want to edit this histogram. The slider bar at the top will let you see different class widths, but we want to choose our class widths manually.   A screenshot from GeoGebra showing the histogram     If you close the menu at the top right by clicking on the left pointing triangle, you will see a settings wheel. Click on the wheel and check the box for set classes manually. To match our previous histogram, we will start at 120 pounds and set a class width of 15 pounds.   A screenshot from GeoGebra showing the box checked for Set Classes Manually.     Now the bars of the histogram match our previous graph, but we need to edit the axis labels to match. Click on the graph tab on the right side and uncheck the box for automatic dimensions. We set the x min, x max, x step, y min, y max and y step as shown.   A screenshot from GeoGebra showing the box uncheckd for Automatic Dimensions. The dimensions entered are xMin 111; xMax 275; xStep 15; yMin -3.4033; yMax: 30.8; yStep 5 (The y-dimensions were automatic)     To put the graph in an assignment or a book such as this one, select the export icon and choose Export as Picture. The downloaded version also has a Copy to Clipboard option. Then insert the graph into any document and add axis labels.   A screenshot from GeoGebra showing the export icon    Here is our finished histogram:    The finished histogram from GeoGebra copied into a Word document. This is the same histogram as in Example 10.      The Shape of a Distribution  Once we have our histogram, we can use it to determine the shape of the data or distribution . When describing distributions, we are going to look at four characteristics: shape, center, spread and outliers. Center and spread (variation) will be covered in the next two sections.    Modality  The modality of a distribution indicates the number of peaks or hills in its histogram.   It is unimodal if it has one peak.    It is bimodal if it has two peaks.    It is multimodal if it has multiple peaks.      The first graph is unimodal , the second is bimodal and the third is multimodal .    Three histograms are shown. The first histogram has one peak. The second histograms has two peaks. The third histogram has three peaks.     A bimodal distribution can result when two different populations have been grouped together and they are overlapping. It would be better to separate them into two separate graphs. For example, the grams of sugar per serving in sugar and non-sugar cereals.    Symmetry  A distribution is symmetric if the left side of the graph mirrors the right side.   The graph on the left is symmetric and unimodal while the graph on the right is roughly symmetric and bimodal.    Two histograms are shown. The first histogram has one peak in the middle and the bars taper down symmetrically on each side. The second histogram has two peaks. Each of the peaks are similar in size and the graph is roughly symmetric.       Skewness  If a distribution is not symmetric then we say it is skewed. A graph can be skewed to the left or skewed to the right . We say it is skewed in the direction of the longer tail.    Skewed to the Left  A left skewed graph is also called a negatively skewed graph. The longer tail will be on the left or negative side.    This is a histogram with 9 bars. The highest bar is to the right of center and the bars go down to the left gradually.      Skewed to the Right  A right skewed graph is also called a positively skewed graph. The longer tail will be on the right or positive side.    This is a histogram with 9 bars. The highest bar is to the left of center and the bars go down to the right gradually.      The Normal Distribution  The normal distribution has a very specific shape. It is unimodal and symmetric with a bell-shaped graph.         Outlier   Outliers are data values that are unusually far away from the rest of the data. There is often a gap between the outlier and the rest of the graph. This visual determination of outliers is often subjective and depends on the situation.    In the graph to the right we have a unimodal distribution that is skewed to the right. There appears to be an outlier near 20.   This distribution has majority of it's data on the left there is a gap in the graph with one bar further away.       Exercises   True or False: The bars of a histogram should always touch.   True    True or False: The bars of a bar graph should always touch.   False    Is the data described categorial or quantitative?   In a study, you ask the subjects their age in years.    In a study, you ask the subjects their gender.    In a study, you ask the subjects their ethnicity.    The daily high temperature of a city over several weeks.    A person's annual income.         Quantitative    Categorical    Categorical    Quantitative    Quantitative       Is the data described categorical or quantitative?   In a study you ask the subjects how many siblings they have.

In a study you ask the subjects the amount they spend on housing each month         Quantitative    Categorical    Quantitative    Quantitative    Quantitative       What types of graphs are used for categorical data?   Bar graphs and pie charts are used for categorical data.    What types of graphs are used for quantitative data?   Histograms are used for quantitative data.    A group of adults were asked how many children they have in their family. The bar graph to the right shows the number of adults who indicated each number of children.    A bar graph showing the frequency for amount of children: 0 kids 5; 2 kid 3; 2 kids 4; 3 kids 2; 4 kids 0; 5 kids 1.       How many adults had 3 children?    How many adults where questioned?    What percentage of the adults questioned had 0 children?         2 had 3 children.    15 adults were questioned.    33.33% of the adults questioned had 0 children.       Jasmine was interested in how many days it would take a DVD order from Netflix to arrive at her door. The graph shows the data she collected.    The x-axis is labeled shipping times (days) with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The y-axis is labeld frequency. The bar for 1 goes up to 4, 2 goes up to 8, 3 goes up to 6, there's no bar at 4 and 5 goes up to 1.       How many movies took 2 days to arrive?    How many movies did she order in total?    What percentage of the movies arrived in one day?         8 movies took 2 days to arrive.    She ordered 19 movies total.    21.05% of the movies arrived in one day.       This relative frequency bar graph shows the percentage of students who received each letter grade on their last English paper. The class contains 20 students. What number of students earned an A on their paper?    There are 4 bars labeled A, B, C, and D. The x-axis is labeled grade on English paper and the y-axis is labeled frequency (%). A goes up to 25%, B goes up to 35%, C goes up to 25% and D goes up to 15%.     5 students earned and A on their paper.    This relative frequency bar graph shows the percentage of each drink type served over the weekend at a local coffee shop. There were 120 drinks served in total. How many served drinks were lattes?    A relative frequency bar graph shows the percentage of each type of coffee drink served over a weekend. For coffee, the relative frequency is 45%. For tea, the relative frequency is 15%. For latte, the relative frequency is 20%. For mocha, the relative frequency is 10%. For cappuccino, the relative frequency is 5%. For other, the relative frequency is 5%.     24 served drinks were lattes.    Corey categorized his spending for this month into four categories: Rent, Food, Fun, and Other. The percentages he spent in each category are pictured here. If he spent a total of $2,600 this month, how much did he spend on rent?    This is a pie chart with four regions. Fun is labeled 16%, Food is labeled 24%, Rent is labeled 26% and Other is labeled 34%.     Cory spent $676 on rent this month.    Habiba categorized the amount of time spent each week into 5 categories: Work, Travel, Housework, Leisure, and Sleep. If there are a total of 168 hours each week, how many hours does Habiba spend travelling each week?    This is a pie chart with five regions. Work is labled 29%, Travel is labeled 7%, Housework is labeled 12%, Leisure is labeled 23% and Sleep is labeled 29%.     Habiba spends 11.8 hours travelling each week.    In a survey Gallup Poll. March 5-8, 2009. , 1012 adults were asked whether they personally worried about a variety of environmental concerns. The number of people who indicated that they worried a great deal about some selected concerns is listed below.   Is this categorical or quantitative data?    Make a bar chart for these data.    Why can't we make a pie chart for these data?       Environmenal Issue  Frequency    Pollution of drinking water  597    Contamination of soil and water by toxic waste  526    Air pollution  455    Global warming  354        These data are categorical.      There are four spaced apart bars labeled Pollution of drinking water, Contamination of soil and water by toxic waste, Air pollution, and Global warming. The x-axis is labeled Environmental Issue and the y-axis is labeled frequncy. Pollution of drinking water goes up to 597, Contamination of soil and drinking water goes up to 526, Air pollution goes up to 455, and Global warming goes up to 354.      No, we cannot make a pie chart out of these data. The total of the relative frequencies is 1932, but only 1012 adults were asked. So some adults selected multiple options.       In a survey, 2056 adults were asked about their views on immigration. The percent of people who responded that immigrants to the United States are making each of the following situations in the country better are listed below.   Is this categorical or quantitative data?    Make a relative frequency bar chart for these data.    Can we make a pie chart for these data?       Situation  Relative Frequency (%)    Food, music and the arts  57    The economy in general  43    Social and moral values  31    Job opportunities for you and your family  19    Taxes  20    Crime  7        These data are categorical.      There are six spaced apart bars labeled Food music and the arts, The economy in general, Social and moral values, Job opportunities for you and your family, Taxes, and Crime. The x-axis is labeled Situation and the y-axis is labeled Relative Frequency (%). Food music and the arts goes up to 57%, The economy in general goes up to 43%, Social and moral values goes up to 31%, Job opportunities for you and your family goes up to 19%, Taxes goes up to 20%, and Crime goes up to 7%.      No, we cannot make a pie chart for these data. The relative frequencies add to 177%, which is more than 100%.       The following table is from a sample of five hundred homes in Oregon that were asked the primary source of heating in their home.   How many of the households heat their home with firewood?    What percent of households heat their home with natural gas?       Type of Heat  Relative Frequency (%)    Electricity  33    Heating Oil  4    Natural Gas  50    Firewood  8    Other  5        40 households heat their home with firewood.    50% of the households heat their home with natural gas.       The following table is from a sample of 50 undergraduate students at Portland State University.   What percent of the sampled students are below senior class?    How many of the sampled students are freshmen?

A group of adults were asked how many cars they had in their household.   Is this categorical or quantitative data?    Make a relative frequency table for the data.    Make a bar chart for the data.    Make a pie chart for the data.    1  4  2  2  1  2  3  3  1  4  2  2  1  2  1  3  2  2  1  2  1  1  1  2           These data are qualitative.      Number of cars in household  Frequency    0-1  7    2-3  14    4-5  3        The histogram is titled \"Histogram of number of cars in household\". The x-axis is labeled Number of Cars, the scale goes from 0 to 6 and jumps by 1 unit. There are three bars, one from 0-2, one from 2-4, and one from 4-6. The y-axis is labeled Frequency and the scale goes from 0 to 16 by units of two. The 0-2 bar goes to 7, the 2-4 bar goes to 14, and the 4-6 bar goes to 3.      These data are unimodal and skewed right, with no outliers.       The table below shows scores on a math test.   Is this categorical or quantitative data?    Make a relative frequency table for the data using a class width of 10.    Construct a histogram of the data.    82  55  51  97  73  79  100  60  71  85  78  59    90  100  88  72  46  82  89  70  100  68  61  52           These are quantitative data.      Math Test Score  Frequency    40-49  1    50-59  4    60-69  3    70-79  6    80-89  5    90-99  2    100-109  3        The histogram is titled \"Histogram of math test scores\". The x-axis is labeled Scores, the scale goes from 40 to 110 and jumps by 10. There are seven bars, one from 40-50, one from 50-60, one from 60-70, one from 70-80, one from 80-90, one from 90-100, and one from 100-110. The y-axis is labeled Frequency and the scale goes from 0 to 8 by two. The 40-50 bar goes to 1, the 50-60 bar goes to 4, the 60-70 bar goes to 3, the 70-80 bar goes to 6, the 80-90 bar goes to 5, the 90-100 bar goes to 2, and the 100-110 bar goes to 3.      These data are unimodal. There are no obvious outliers. The data are either symmetric or skewed left.       This graph shows the number of adults and kids who prefer each type of soda. There were 130 adults and kids surveyed. Discuss some ways in which the graph could be improved.    This is a 3 dimensional double bar graph. There is a bar for kids and a bar for adults. The x-axis is labeled coke, diet coke, sprite and cherry soda. The y-axis starts at 20 and goes to 45 with a scale of 5.     The graph would be more effective at displaying the true differences between the categories if the vertical scale started at 0. The vertical axis is missing a label and units, so we can't tell if those are frequencies or relative frequencies. A flat bar graph (instead of the 3d graph) would be easier to read.    A poll was taken asking people if they agreed with the positions of the 4 candidates for a county office. Does this pie chart present a good representation of these data? Explain.    A pie chart with 4 regions: Nguyen is labeled 42%, McKee is labeled 35%, Jones is labeled 64% and Brown is labeled 52%.     No, this chart does not present a good representation of these data. The percentages in a pie chart must add to 100%, but these add to 193%. A bar chart would be appropriate instead.    Why is this a misleading or poor graph?    This is a bar graph and is titled \"Favorite Drinks\". The x-axis is labeled Drink Type and includes colas, lemon flavored, root beer, teas, coffee, and other. The y-axis is labeled frequency and has no scale.     This is a poor graph because the vertical axis does not have a numerical scale, so we cannot know how many have each drink as a favorite drink. We also don't know if the bottom vertical line represents 0, which is potentially misleading.    Why is this a misleading or poor graph?    This is a bar graph and is titled \"Profit During First Half of Year\". The x-axis is labeled Year and includes January, February, March, April, May, and June. The y-axis is labeled Profits in $. The scale goes from 0 to 4500 by 500. The bar for each month is labeled with the following values: January 4230, February 3760, March 2670, April -1320, May 750, and June 1560. The bar for April is colored red while the remaining bars are colored blue.     This is a misleading graph because the -$1320 in April represents a loss (instead of a profit), but the height of the bar for April looks like a profit. Also, the horizontal axis label is Year , but the bar labels are months.    Match each description to one of the graphs.   Normal distribution    Positive or right skewed    Negative or left skewed    Bimodal       The frequency of times between eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser.   This histogram has a tall bar on the left side, then the bars decrease significantly and then increase for a peak on the right side.     Scores on a 20-point statistics quiz.   This histogram has shorter bars to the left, which gradually get taller. The tallest bar is on the right side of the graph.       The distribution of scores on a psychology test.   This histogram increases sharply and then decreases gradually. The peak is just to the left of the center.     The number of heads in 24 sets of 100 coin flips.   This histogram is symmetric. The highest bar is in the middle and the bars decrease in height as you move away from the middle.         Normal distribution – The number of heads in 24 sets of 100 coin flips.    Positive or right skewed – Distribution of scores on a psychology test.    Negative or left skewed – Scores on a 20-point statistics quiz.    Bimodal – The frequency of times between eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser.       Write a sentence or two to describe each distribution in terms of modality, symmetry, skewness and outliers.    This histogram has the tallest bars on the left side and then decreases to the right.    The bars in this histogram increase gradually to the center and then decrease. The bars drop off slightly faster to the right.      The bars in this histogram increase sharply to the tallest bars on the left side, then decrease and increase to the second tallest bar, then decrease again to the right.    The bars on this histogram start out at a middle height and then go down and up in a U shape to the tallest bar to the right of center. Then the bars decrease and increase again for another tall bar on the right.    The bars on this histogram gradually increase to the right and drop of quickly after the peak toward the right side of the graph.        This distribution is unimodal and right skewed. There is a possible outlier between 10 and 11.    This distribution is unimodal and symmetric. There are no outliers.    This distribution is unimodal and right skewed. There are no obvious outliers.    This distribution is multimodal and left skewed. There are no outliers.    This distribution is unimodal and left skewed. There are no obvious outliers.       Studies are often done by pharmaceutical companies to determine the effectiveness of a treatment. Suppose that a new cancer drug is currently under study. Of interest is the average length of time in months patients live once starting the treatment. Two researchers each follow a different set of 40 cancer patients throughout their treatment. The following data (in months) are collected.   Create a histogram for each dataset, using the same class intervals and scales so you can compare them.    Compare and contrast the two distributions.  Researcher 1 Patients (in months):     3  4  11  15  16  17  22  44  37  16  14  24  25  15  26  27  33  29  35  44    13  21  22  10  12  8  40  32  26  27  31  34  29  17  8  24  18  47  33  34     Researcher 2 Patients (in months):     3  14  11  5  16  17  28  41  31  18  14  14  26  25  21  22  31  2  35  44    23  21  21  16  12  18  41  22  16  25  33  34  29  13  18  24  23  42  33  29                        The data for patients of both researchers are symmetric. Researcher's 1 patients' data appears to be unimodal, but Researcher 2's patients' data may be bimodal or multimodal. The data for Researcher 1's patients does not have any outliers, but the data for Researcher's 2 may have outliers between 0 and 5 months or 40 and 45 months.       "

A survey about the movie you most recently saw includes the question, \"How would you rate the movie?\" with these possible answers:   It was awful.    It was just okay.    I liked it.    It was great.    Best movie ever!        Again, there are numbers associated with the responses, but these are really categories. A movie that rates a 4 is not necessarily twice as good as a movie that rates a 2, whatever that means; However, we often see that a movie got an average of 3.7 stars, which is an average of categorical ratings and it can give us important information.

The average manager salary is twice as high as the average worker salary as in a bar graph, but the image is also twice as wide.

There are two bags of money shown. One is larger labeled Mananger Salaries. The other is half as tall and half as wide and labeled workers salaries. There are no numbers or scale shown.    "

  "body": " Summary Statistics: Measures of Center   Summary Statistics: Measures of Center   Students will be able to:     Calculate and describe the measures of center: mean and median    Analyze the relationship of the mean and median to the shape of the data       Alternative Video Lesson      Calculating Summary Statistics  In addition to graphical and verbal descriptions, we can use numbers to summarize quantitative distributions. We want to know what an average value is (where the data is centered), and how spread out the values are. Together, the center and spread provide important information which can be used to estimate our population parameters. In this section we will discuss the measures of center and in the next section we will discuss the measures of spread.    Measures of Center  There are a few different types of averages that measure the center, and the one we use will depend on the shape of the distribution. We will mention the mode but focus mainly on the two most common averages : the mean and the median .    Mode  In the previous section, we saw that the modes are related to the peaks where similar values are grouped. The mode is the value with the highest frequency (A mode is the value where a peak occurs. One additional way to calculate the mode(s) is to take the midpoint of each peak in the histogram.)    Mean  The mean , or more formally the arithmetic mean, is what probably comes to mind when you hear the word average. The calculation of the mean uses every data value in the distribution and is therefore strongly affected by skew and outliers.  To calculate the mean of a distribution, we divide the sum of the data values by the number of data values we have. The sample mean is usually represented by, a lower-case with a bar over it, read-bar. The lower-case letter n is used to represent the number of data values or sample size .   Mean        Mirabel's exam scores for her last math class were: 79, 86, 82, and 94. What is her mean test score?    To find the mean test score we need to find the sum of her test scores, then divide the sum by the number of test scores ( ). The mean is:   points  We will round the sample mean to one more decimal place than the original data. In this case, we would round 85.25 to 85.3 points. Also notice that the mean has the same units as the data and it is important to label it.    It is reasonable to calculate the mean by hand when the data set is small, but if the data set is large, or if you will be finding additional statistics, then technology is the way to go. We can find the mean of a data set using the spreadsheet formula =AVERAGE .   The price of peanut butter in dollars at 5 stores was 3.29, 3.59, 3.79, 3.75, and 3.99. Find the mean price using a spreadsheet.  There are two ways to use the =AVERAGE formula. If your data set is not too large, you can enter each value directly into the formula. Using this method, we write   =AVERAGE(3.29 3.59, 3.79, 3.75, 3.99)     A screenshot of Excel showing the =AVERAGE formula typed in with the values.    and we get an answer of $3.68.  The other method is to enter the data values into a single column (or row) of the spreadsheet and reference the column (or row) range in the formula. We can enter the range by highlighting the data values. As illustrated below, if we enter the data into column A, the formula is   =AVERAGE(A1:A5)     A screenshot of Excel showing the =AVERAGE formula typed in with the cell references. The data is in column A    and we also get an answer of $3.68.   Sometimes when there is a lot of data with repeated values we are given a frequency table.   One hundred families from a particular neighborhood are randomly selected and asked to give their annual household income rounded to the nearest $5,000. The results are shown in the frequency table below.    Income (thousands of dollars)  Frequency    $15  6    $20  8    $25  11    $30  17    $35  19    $40  20    $45  12    $50  7    Calculating the mean by hand could get tedious if we try to type in all 100 values:     We could calculate this more easily by noticing that adding 15 to itself six times is the same as . Using this simplification, we get     The mean household income of our sample is 33.9 thousand dollars or $33,900.   We could also use =AVERAGE to find the mean for this example, but it would require entering each repeated value individually. If the mean is all we need, then taking advantage of multiplication as repeated addition is the more straightforward way to go. We could also enter the frequency table and the calculation above in a spreadsheet.   Extending the last example, suppose a new family moves into the neighborhood and has a household income of $5 million ($5000 thousand). Adding this to our sample, our mean becomes:     While 83.1 thousand dollars, or $83,100 is the correct mean household income for the new sample, it is no longer representative of the neighborhood – in fact, it is greater than every income in the sample aside from the new one we added!   Imagine the data values on a see-saw or balance scale. The mean is the value at the tip of the triangle that keeps the data in balance, like in the picture below.    A drawing of a see-saw with rectangles to indicate the data values. Most of the data values are to the left of the fulcrum; the two values to the right are spread out which causes the data to be balanced.    If we graph our household data, the $5 million value is so far out to the right that the mean has to adjust to keep things in balance.    With the outlier data value added, the see-saw is extended with that value far to the right. Now all of the original data values are to the left of the fulcrum.    For this reason, when working with data that is skewed or has outliers, it is common to use a different measure of center, the median.    Median  The median of a data set is the middle value, when the data are listed in order from smallest to largest. We can also think of the median as the value that has 50% of the data below it and 50% of data above it. As we will discover later, the median is also the 50th percentile .   Median  If the number of data values is odd, then the median is the middle data value If the number of data values is even, then the median is the mean of the middle pair    Finding the median of an odd number of values.  Use the following quiz scores in points:     5  10  8  6  4  8  2  5  7  7  6     We must start by listing the data in order:     2  4  5  5  6  6  7  7  8  8  10     It is helpful to mark or cross off the numbers as you list them to make sure you don't miss any. Also, be sure to count the number of data values in your ordered list to make sure it matches the number of data values in the original list.  In this example there are 11 quiz scores. When the distribution contains an odd number of data values there will be a single number in the middle and that is the median. For small data sets, we can “walk” one value at a time from the ends of the ordered list towards the center to find the median     The median test score is 6 points.    Finding the median of an even number of values.  Use the following quiz scores in points:     2  4  5  5  6  6  7  7  8  8  10  20     There are now 12 quiz scores in our sample. When the distribution contains an even number of data values there will be a pair of values in the middle rather than a single value. Then we take the average of the middle two values.     Median points  Notice that despite adding an outlier to our data set, the median is largely unaffected. The median quiz score for the new distribution is 6.5 points. The median is not as affected by outliers as the mean is.  We can also find the median using the spreadsheet formula =MEDIAN . Just like the spreadsheet function =AVERAGE , we can either list the individual data values in the formula, or we can enter the data values into a row (or column) and use the row range (or column range) in the formula.  Using the data values of the original distribution, we can write the function as   =MEDIAN(2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10) or   =MEDIAN(A1:AK)     A screenshot of Excel showing the =MEDIAN formula typed in with the cell references. The data is in row 1    and we get 6 points for the median test score.    Let's continue with our peanut butter example and find the median both by hand and with a spreadsheet. The price of peanut butter at 5 stores in dollars was:     3.29  3.59  3.79  3.75  3.99     To find the median by hand, we must first list the prices in order. This give us:     3.29  3.59  3.75  3.79  3.99     Since there are an odd number of data values in the sample ( ), we know that the median will be the single data value in the middle of the ordered list.     The median price of peanut butter at these five stores is $3.75.  Using a spreadsheet, we write   =MEDIAN(3.29, 3.59, 3.79, 3.75, 3.99)     A screenshot of Excel showing the =MEDIAN formula with all the data values typed in.    and we get a median price of $3.75.   It is worth noting that when you use a spreadsheet to find the median you do not have to order the data first. You can enter the data values in the order they are given to you.    The Relationship Between the Mean and the Median  If a distribution is skewed, the mean is pulled in the direction of the skew, as we saw in the see-saw diagram. In a right skewed distribution, the mean is greater than the median, while in a left skewed distribution, the mean is less than the median. If the distribution is symmetric, the mean and the median will be approximately equal.  To demonstrate this, we have entered some data in GeoGebra, as previously explained, and made histograms. To see the statistics that GeoGebra calculates, we click on the summation symbol on the right-hand menu bar.   Fifty people from the Portland Metro area who are employed full time were sampled and their annual salaries were recorded (to the nearest thousand dollars). The histogram and summary statistics from GeoGebra are shown below.  From the histogram we can see that the shape of the distribution is unimodal and skewed to the right. We can see from the statistics output on the left that the mean is greater than the median. This is because the few people with higher incomes bring the average up.   Mean , Median , Mean Median   A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the histogram is skewed to the right. The statistics output shows the mean is $67,160 and the Median is $53,500.      A random selection of 30 math 105 exams at PCC were sampled and their scores were recorded. The histogram of the resulting distribution is shown below.  The shape of the distribution is unimodal and skewed to the left. There also appears to be an outlier between 20 and 30. We can see from the statistics output that the mean is less than the median. This is because the low test score brought the average down. points points   Mean points, Median points, Mean Median   A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the histogram is skewed to the left. The statistics output shows the mean is 81.7 points and the Median is 87.5 points.      Nineteen people identifying as female were sampled and their heights (in inches) were recorded. The histogram of the resulting distribution is shown below.  The shape of the distribution is unimodal and roughly symmetric. We can also see from the statistics output that the mean and the median are approximately equal. inches inches   Mean inches, Median inches Mean Median   A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the histogram is approximately symmetric. The statistics output shows the mean is 62.6 inches and the Median is 62 inches.     We can use these observations in reverse as well. If we know the mean is greater than the median, then we can expect the distribution to be skewed to the right. If the mean is less than the median, then we can expect the distribution to be skewed to the left. When the mean and the median are approximately equal, the distribution is likely to be symmetric.    Recent college graduates were asked how much student loan debt they have. The data has a mean of $46,265 and a median of $33,652. Just based on this information, do you expect the distribution to be symmetric, skewed to the left, or skewed to the right?    Since the mean is greater than the median, we can expect the distribution to be skewed to the right.      Exercises   A group of diners were asked how much they would pay for a breakfast in dollars.

Then use the Show Statistics option.     The sum of the frequencies is 75, so        In GeoGebra Classic, enter the costs into the column A and frequencies into column B of the spreadsheet and use the One Variable Analysis function. Then use the Show Statistics option.     Since there are 75 values (an odd number), we know that the median will be the single middle data value. Because , we know it will be the 38th value in the list. The 38th value is 35, so the median is 35 thousand dollars.    Since the mean is less than the median, we would expect the distribution to be skewed left.       As part of a study of email, a researcher counted the length of 34 emails. The lengths of the emails are shown below, rounded to the nearest thousand characters (so a length 0 means that the numbers of characters rounded to 0, not that the message was blank). The data is from Advanced High School Statistics, 2nd Ed. ( ).      Calculate and find the mean, including units.    Can you figure out how to find the median using the frequency table?

Then use the Show Statistics option.     The sum of the frequencies is 34, so        In GeoGebra Classic, enter the costs into the column A and frequencies into column B of the spreadsheet and use the One Variable Analysis function. Then use the Show Statistics option.     Since there are 34 values (an even number), we know that the median will be the mean of the two middle values. Because , we know the two middle values are the 17th and 18th values. The 17th value is 4, and the 18th value is 5, so the median is 4.5 thousand characters.    Since the mean is greater than the median, we expect the distribution to be skewed right.       Studies are often done by pharmaceutical companies to determine the effectiveness of a treatment.

The US Census Bureau, in addition to counting the population of the US every 10 years, conducts yearly informational surveys, such as the American Community Survey (ACS). For the 2012 ACS, a randomly chosen group of 20 respondents (10 males, 10 females) answered a question about their incomes. Data from Advanced High School Statistics, 2nd Ed. Section 2.1 Exercise #1. ( ).   Income in dollars for people who identify as female:     1,600  1,200  20,000  25,000  670  29,000  44,000  30,000  5,800  50,000     Income in dollars for people who identify as male:     53,000  70,000  12,800  30,000  4,500  42,000  48,000  60,000  108,000  11,000        Find the mean and median of each group.    Compare and contrast the two groups.         For Males:  In Excel   =average(53000,70000,12800,30000,4500,42000,48000,60000,108000,11000)       =median(53000,70000,12800,30000,4500,42000,48000,60000,108000,11000)      The mean for males is $43,930, and the median for males is $45,000.  For Females:   =average(1600,1200,20000,25000,670,29000,44000,30000,5800,50000)       =median(1600,1200,20000,25000,670,29000,44000,30000,5800,50000)      The mean for females is $20,727, and the median for females is $22,500    Both the mean income and median income for the males in the sample were twice as large as the mean income and median income for the females in the sample. The difference between the mean and median income for the females was slightly larger than the mean and median income for the males, so the distribution of incomes for the females is possibly more skewed than the distribution for the males.

Histogram for Average Number of Pieces Correctly Remembered by Non-players     Histogram for Average Number of Pieces Correctly Remembered by Beginners      Histogram for Average Number of Pieces Correctly Remembered by Tournament Players       The mean number of pieces correctly remembered for non-players was 33.65 pieces.  The mean number of pieces correctly remembered for beginners was 47.6 pieces.  The mean number of pieces correctly remembered for tournament players was 64.98 pieces.    The median number of pieces correctly remembered for non-players was 33.5 pieces.  The median number of pieces correctly remembered for beginners was 51.3 pieces.  The median number of pieces correctly remembered for tournament players was 71.1 pieces.    The distribution for non-players appears to be uniform. The distribution for beginners looks unimodal and left-skewed. The distribution for tournament players appears bimodal and symmetric.  The mean and median number of pieces correctly remembered were both greatest for tournament players, with non-players having the smallest mean and median of pieces correctly remembered.       There is evidence that smiling can attenuate judgments of possible wrongdoing. This phenomenon termed the \"smile-leniency effect\" was the focus of a study by Marianne LaFrance & Marvin Hecht in 1995 LaFrance, M., & Hecht, M. A. (1995) Why smiles generate leniency. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 21, 207-214. Adapted from , by David M. Lane, et al, used under CC-BY-SA 3.0 . . The following data are measurements of how lenient the sentences were for three different types of smiles and one neutral control. A higher number indicates greater leniency. The same subject was used for all of the conditions so that may affect the results.   Make a histogram for each smile type and the neutral control.    Find the mean for each type of smile and the neutral control.    Find the median for each type of smile and the neutral control.    Compare the shapes of the distributions as well as the centers for each type of smile and control.

The mean leniency for the felt smile group was 4.9.  The mean leniency for the miserable smile group was 4.9.  The mean leniency for the neutral control group was 4.1.    The median leniency for the false smile group was 5.5.  The median leniency for the felt smile group was 4.8.  The median leniency for the miserable smile group was 4.8.  The median leniency for the neutral control group was 4.0.    Answers will vary depending on the graphs created. The shape of the false smile is bimodal, whereas the miserable smile and neutral control groups are both unimodal. The miserable smile and neutral control both appear to be skewed to the right, however, comparing the mean to the median we see that there is not much of a difference. Therefore, none of the graphs are skewed. The felt smile group is the most visually uniform. The measures of center (mean and median) have the center of the false smile near 5.5, the felt smile and miserable smile both near 4.8, and the control near 4       Make up three data sets with 5 values each that have:   The same mean but different medians    The same median but different means.         There are many possible answers for this problem. Three data sets with 5 values each that have the same mean but different medians are:    0,  0,  0,  0,  10    0,  0,  2,  4,  4    0,  1,  1,  1,  7      There are many possible answers for this problem. Three data sets with 5 values that have the same median but different means are:    10,  10,  10,  10,  10    0,  0,  10,  15,  20    1,  5,  10,  10,  10         The frequency table below shows the number of women's shoes that were sold in an hour at a local shoe store.     Would you treat this data as categorical or quantitative?    How would the bar graph be different from the histogram?    Treat the data as quantitative and find the mean and the median. Are these useful statistics?    Shoe Size  Frequency    5  4    6  4    7  6    8  6    9  5           Argument for categorical: Because it is not clear that the shoe sizes represent a measure, the data can be considered categorical.  Argument for quantitative: Because shoe size is a measurement that corresponds to the length of someone's foot, it can be treated as quantitative data.    Each graph would have frequency along the y-axis. In a bar graph the bars would have spaces between them and each bar would be labeled with the shoe size. In a histogram there would not be any spaces between the bars and the shoe sizes could be the scale on the x-axis.    The mean shoe size to be 7.2 and the median shoe size to be 7.  The mean shoe size is:     Since there are 25 values (an odd number), we know that the median will be the single middle data value. Because , we know it will be the 13th value in the list. The 13th value is 7, so the median shoe size is 7.  The mean and median shoe size might be useful statistics to the store. If shoe size is positively correlated to height, then a shoe store with a comparatively larger mean or median shoe size could determine that their clients are, on average, comparatively taller. (Other answers are possible.)       At the end of the term, 400 students take a final exam, and their scores (as percentages) are plotted in a histogram. Graph and description from Advanced High School Statistics, 2nd Ed. Section 2.2 Exercise. ( )     The bars gradually increase going to the right with the tallest bars near the right side of the graph, then they decrease sharply.       Is the graph shown above skewed right, skewed left, or symmetric? Explain why you chose your answer.    Based on your answer to part (a), which would you expect: that the mean is less than the median, the mean is greater than the median, or that the mean and median are equal?         This graph is skewed left.    I expect that the mean is less than the median because the graph is skewed left.       The following graph shows the distribution of yearly incomes of 40 patrons at a college coffee shop. Graph and description from Advanced High School Statistics, 2nd Ed. Section 2.2 Exercise. ( )     The bars on the histogram increase gradually with the tallest bars in the center, then decrease gradually.       Is the graph shown above skewed right, skewed right, or symmetric? Explain why you chose your answer.    Based on your answer to part (a), which would you expect: that the mean is less than the median, the mean is greater than the median, or that the mean and median are equal?         This graph is symmetric. The graph has a single peak between $65,000 an $66,000, and there are approximately an equal number of data values on either side of this peak.    I expect that the mean and median are equal because the graph is symmetric.       For each of the following distributions, would you expect that the mean is less than the median, greater than the median, or approximately equal to the median? Explain your reasoning.     Household incomes in the US    Weights of newborn babies born at term    The number of children in a household in the US    Medical costs for all adults    Medical costs for adults in the US older than 65         Incomes are skewed to the right so the mean would be greater than the median.    Weights are approximately symmetric so the mean would be about the same as the median.    Number of children is skewed to the right so the mean would be greater than the median.    Medical costs for all adults are most likely skewed to the right so the mean would be greater than the median.    Medical costs for adults 65+ may be symmetric or skewed to the right. Answer according to the shape you chose.       "

The shape of the false smile is bimodal, whereas the miserable smile and neutral control groups are both unimodal. The miserable smile and neutral control both appear to be skewed to the right, however, comparing the mean to the median we see that there is not much of a difference. Therefore, none of the graphs are skewed. The felt smile group is the most visually uniform. The measures of center (mean and median) have the center of the false smile near 5.5, the felt smile and miserable smile both near 4.8, and the control near 4     "

  "body": " Summary Statistics: Measures of Variation   Summary Statistics: Measures of Variation   Students will be able to:     Calculate and describe the measures of variation: standard deviation, range and interquartile range (IQR)    Calculate the 5-number summary and construct boxplots by hand and\/or using technology (boxplots using technology may be modified or not)    Compare distributions with side-by-side boxplots and percentiles    Calculate and apply Z-scores       Alternative Video Lessons      Measures of Variation  Consider these three sets of quiz scores for a 10-point quiz:  Section A:     5  5  5  5  5  5  5  5  5  5     Section B:     0  0  0  0  0  10  10  10  10  10     Section C:     4  4  4  5  5  5  5  6  6  6     All three data sets have a mean of 5 points and median of 5 points, yet the sets of scores are clearly quite different. In Section A, everyone had the same score; in Section B half the class got no points and the other half got a perfect score. Section C was not as consistent as section A, but not as widely varied as section B.  Thus, in addition to the mean and median, which are measures of center or the average value, we also need a measure of how spread out \" or varied each data set is.  There are several ways to measure the variation of a distribution. In this section we will look at the standard deviation , range and the interquartile range (IQR) .    Standard Deviation  The sample standard deviation, s , is a measure of variation that tells us how far, on average, the data values deviate, or are different from, the mean. The mean and standard deviation are paired to provide a measure of center and spread for symmetric distributions.   Sample Standard Deviation     where is the sample size, or the number of data values   We will go through the whole process for calculating the standard deviation. Let's say there is another section of quiz scores:  Section D:     0  5  5  5  5  5  5  5  5  10     The mean quiz score, like Sections A, B and C, is 5 points.  The first step in finding the standard deviation is to find the deviation, or difference, of each data value from the mean. We will do this in a table. You could also use a spreadsheet to do these calculations.    Data Value  Deviation: (Data Value – Mean)    0     5     5     5     5     5     5     5     5     10     We would like to get an idea of the average deviation from the mean, but if we find the average of the values in the second column, the negative and positive values cancel each other out (this will always happen), so to prevent this we square the deviations.    Data Value  Deviation: (Data Value – Mean)  Deviation Squared    0      5      5      5      5      5      5      5      5      10      Next, we add the squared deviations and we get     Ordinarily, we would then divide by the number of scores, , (in this case, 10) to find the mean of the deviations, but the division by is only done if the data set represents a population. When the data set represents a sample (as it almost always does), we divide by (in this case,).  We assume Section D represents a sample, so we will divide by 9. Note that our units are now points-squared since we squared all of the deviations. It is much more meaningful to use the units we started with, so to convert back to points we take the square root.  The sample standard deviation for Section D is     For comparison, here is the standard deviation for each section listed above:   points   points   points   points  For the standard deviation, we usually use two more decimal places than the original data. This tells us that on average, scores were 2.36 points away from the mean of 5 points. In summary, here are the steps to calculate the standard deviation by hand.   Calculating the Sample Standard Deviation     Find the deviations by subtracting the mean from each data value    Square each deviation    Add the squared deviations    Compute the square root of the sum divided by :         There are a few important characteristics we want to keep in mind when finding and interpreting the standard deviation.   The standard deviation is never negative. It will be zero if all the data values are equal and get larger as the data spreads out.    The standard deviation has the same units as the original data and it is important to label it.    The standard deviation, like the mean, can be highly influenced by outliers.      To continue our peanut butter example, we will find the standard deviation of this sample in dollars: 3.29, 3.59, 3.79, 3.75, and 3.99.  The first thing we need to find is the sample mean, and we know it is $3.68 from our previous work. Next, we need to find the deviation from the mean for each data value and square it.    Data Value  Deviation  Deviation Squared    $3.29      $3.59      $3.79      $3.75      $3.99      The sum of the deviations squared is     The sample standard deviation is     Since the units are dollars, we will round to two decimal places rather than two more than the data. This gives us a standard deviation of $0.26. Together with the mean this tells us that on average, the cost of a jar of peanut butter is $0.26 away from the mean of $3.68.   Calculating the standard deviation by hand can be quite a nuisance when we are dealing with a large data set, so we can also use technology. We use the spreadsheet function =STDEV.S to find the sample standard deviation. Notice that this is different from the population standard deviation, which uses the function =STDEV.P .  Just like the spreadsheet functions =AVERAGE and =MEDIAN , we can either list the individual data values in the formula, or we can enter the data values into a row or column and use the row or column range in the formula.    The total cost of textbooks, in dollars, for the term was collected from 36 students. Use a spreadsheet to find the mean, median, and standard deviation of the sample.     140  160  160  165  180  220  235  240  250  260  280  285    285  285  290  300  300  305  310  310  315  315  320  320    330  340  345  350  355  360  360  380  395  420  460  460     Since we are finding more than one statistic for this data set, it is much more efficient to enter the data values into a row or column and reference the range in each of the formulas. We enter the data into column A.     For the mean we enter: =AVERAGE(A1:A36) and get a result of $299.58.  For the median we enter: =MEDIAN(A1:A36) and get a result of $307.50.  For the standard deviation we enter: =STDEV.S(A1:A36) and get $78.68.   The mean and the median are relatively close to each other, so we can expect the distribution to be approximately symmetric with maybe a slight skew to the left, since the mean is smaller. The mean and standard deviation together tell us that the average cost of textbooks for a term is about $299.58, give or take $78.68.    In addition to a spreadsheet, we will continue our use of GeoGebra. Let's take a look at how to use GeoGeogebra to find the mean, median and standard deviation for the last example. We begin just like we did for making a histogram.    continued: We enter the textbook data into column A of the spreadsheet in GeoGebra. (Main Menu →View →Spreadsheet). Next, select the column title of your data, click on the histogram in the menu bar on the left, and select One Variable Analysis.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the icon for One Variable Analysis    Then you will see the histogram. It is always a good idea to check the shape of your distribution before calculating anything. Notice our histogram matches what we found about the distribution from the mean and median. It is approximately symmetric or slightly skewed to the left.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the histogram. The summation symbol to show summary statistics is on the right side.    Next, we click the summation symbol in the menu bar on the right. The list of summary statistics will pop up as you can see in the image below. We see that the mean is $299.58, the median is $307.50 and the sample standard deviation is $78.68 – just like we found using the spreadsheet formulas.  The statistics we will use are the sample size , the mean, median, and the sample standard deviation . The last five entries in the table – min, Q1, median, Q3, and max – together make up the 5-number summary which we will learn about shortly!    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the data, histogram and summary statistics.    The standard deviation is the measure of variation that we pair with the mean for approximately symmetric distributions. This pairing should make sense because the standard deviation uses the mean in its calculation. But what about the median? What measure of variation do we pair with it?     Range  One candidate is the range . The range tells us the spread or width of the entire data set. We calculate the range as the difference between the maximum and minimum value.   Range      However, the range is not a very good measure of variation since it is very strongly affected by skew and outliers. Consider, for example, the distribution of full time salaries in the United States. Many people earn a minimum wage salary, while others like Jeff Bezos (Amazon) and Bill Gates (Microsoft) earn millions (if not billions!). A range this large does very little to help us get a sense of the spread where most of the data values lie.    Quartiles and the Interquartile Range  Instead, the measure of variation that we pair with the median is the interquartile range (IQR) . The IQR tells us the width of the middle 50% of data values. By cutting off the lower and upper 25% of data values, we are able to ignore extreme values and provide a more accurate sense of how spread out the distribution is.  The IQR is calculated as the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). Before we can calculate the interquartile range, though, we need to learn how to find the first and third quartiles.   Interquartile Range (IQR)      As the name implies, quartiles are values that divide the data into quarters. The first quartile (Q1) is the value that 25% of the data lie below. The third quartile (Q3) is the value that 75% of the data lie below. As you might have guessed, the second quartile is the same as the median since 50% of the data values lie below it.  We have seen that the data is split in half by the median so to split it into quarters, we find the median of each half of the data.   Quartiles   the median of the lower half of the data   is the median of the whole data set   is the median of the upper half of the data  If there is an odd number of data values, we don't use the median in either half     For an even number of data values: Suppose we have measured the height, in inches, of 12 people who identify as female. The data values are listed below. Find the interquartile range.     59  60  69  64  70  72  66  64  67  66  63  61       Just like when finding the median, we must first order the data.     59  60  61  63  64  64  66  66  67  69  70  72     Then we divide the data into two halves. In the case of an even sample size, we split the distribution down the middle. The first 6 data values are the lower half and the next 6 data values are the upper half. Then we find the median of each. The median of the lower half is Q1 and the median of the upper half is Q3.      In this data inches, and inches. Then we subtract to find the IQR.     This tells us the that the middle 50% of the women's heights lie within an interval of 6 inches.      For an odd number of data values: Suppose we added one more height (68 inches) to the data set from the previous example. We will again find the interquartile range of the heights.     59  60  61  63  64  64  66  66  67  68  69  70  72       The data are already in order, but we have an odd number of values. To deal with this we do not use the median in the upper or lower halves. The lower half will include the values strictly below the median, and the upper half will include the values strictly above the median.     Then the interquartile range is:     If the data set is small, we can find the first and third quartiles by hand, but we have also seen that they are part of the output from GeoGebra. Here is the output for this data.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the data and the summary statistics.    From the list of summary statistics we can see that and inches. Now we can calculate the interquartile range.     This is the same value we found by hand.    It is important to note that we are not using spreadsheets for the five-number summary because they do not calculate the quartiles in the same way, so they will not give the same results. Now that we have learned how to find the quartiles we can make a five-number summary and boxplot.    The Five-Number Summary and Boxplots  The five-number summary is made up of the minimum, Q1, median, Q3, and the maximum. These five values divide the data into quarters. A boxplot , also called a box-and-whisker plot , is a graphical representation of the five-number summary. Each region of the boxplot contains approximately the same number of data values, so we can see the spread for each region. We can find the five-number summary and draw a boxplot by hand or by using GeoGebra. In our last example the five-number summary from GeoGebra is: 59, 62, 66, 68.5, 72 inches.   Five-Number Summary      We will use GeoGebra to find the five-number summary for the next example and then explain how to draw a boxplot.    Let's continue with the cost of textbook data in dollars from . Use GeoGebra to find the five-number summary for this sample and draw a boxplot by hand.     140  160  160  165  180  220  235  240  250  260  280  285    285  285  290  300  300  305  310  310  315  315  320  320    330  340  345  350  355  360  360  380  395  420  460  460       As we found before, here is the GeoGebra output. The last five entries of the summary statistics are the five-number summary. Remember to label all of your statistics with units.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the data and the summary statistics.    The five-number summary is    Min   Median   Max    $140  $255  $307.50  $347.50  $460    To draw the boxplot, we will first draw a number line that extends a little beyond the minimum and maximum values, and choose a scale. We decided to draw our number line from $120 to $480, in increments of $40. Then we add a meaningful title and units.  Next, make vertical lines at the first quartile, median and third quartile and connect them to form a box. This is the middle 50% of the data and you might notice that the width of the box is the IQR. Then, extend the whiskers out to the minimum and maximum values. Note that a boxplot does not have a vertical scale and the height of the box does not matter. Our boxplot looks like this:    A boxplot with a horizontal scale from $120 to $480 with a scale of $40.    GeoGebra will also draw boxplots for us. We enter and select the data values like we have done before and select One Variable Statistics. This brings up the graphics window with a histogram by default. Use the drop-down menu to select the boxplot. We also click on to show the summary statistics.      We will continue with our height data, in inches, from the 12 people who identify as women. Find the five-number summary and create a boxplot using GeoGebra.       59  60  69  64  70  72  66  64  67  66  63  61     Following the steps above we have the following GeoGebra output. The last five entries in the statistics table are the five-number summary and we have the boxplot on the right.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showint the data, summary statistics and the boxplot.    Here is the five-number summary:    Min   Median   Max    59in  62in  65in  68in  72in    For this data, the two sides of the box and the two whiskers are approximately the same width. This suggests that the distribution is symmetric. We can verify this by noticing that the mean is approximately equal to the median.  The boxplot can tell us the shape of the distribution, but we cannot tell how many peaks the data has. For that we need a histogram. We can see the histogram and boxplot together by selecting the icon that looks like two rectangles stacked, or an = sign.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the histogram and boxplot stacked.    Now we have a full picture of the data.    The default boxplot in GeoGebra is called a modified box plot , which shows the data values that are outliers with an X but requires a few more steps to make by hand. To change from the modified box plot to a regular box plot, click on the left pointing arrow in the boxplot window (downloaded version) or the settings wheel (online version) for options, and uncheck “show outliers.” The output window below shows two side-by-side boxplots (the regular boxplot on top and the modified boxplot on the bottom) illustrating the distribution of the annual salaries for 50 randomly selected full-time workers in the Portland Metro area.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing two boxplots for the same data stacked. The first one is the regular boxplot and show outliers is unchecked; the second one has 4 outliers on the right side and the box for show outliers is checked.    From the upper boxplot we can see that this distribution is skewed to the right and the upper quarter of the data is very spread out. It is natural to think of the data values as being evenly spread out in each region, but that is quite often not the case. From the lower boxplot we can see that there are 4 data values that are considered outliers and how far away the last data value is from the others. This is why it is useful to show outliers on a boxplot.    Modified Boxplot (Optional)  If you are curious to know how a modified boxplot is made, we will explain it briefly. There is a rule called the 1.5*IQR rule to determine which points are considered outliers. An outlier is a point that is more than 1.5 IQRs away from the middle 50% of the data (the box in the boxplot). We know how to calculate the IQR and then we multiply that by 1.5. We subtract that from Q1 to find the lower fence and add that value to Q3 to find the upper fence . Values beyond the fences are considered outliers and are drawn with an X or a star. Then we draw the whiskers of a modified box plot to the furthest data value inside the fence on each side.    Percentiles  Back when we were finding the median, we mentioned that the median is also called the 50th percentile, because 50% of the data values lie below it. We can define any percentile as the data value with that percentage of values below it. Since we have found the quartiles, we can also identify the 25th and 75th percentiles for our data. Q1 is the 25th percentile because 25% of the data values lie below it and Q3 is the 75th percentile because 75% of the data values lie below it.  Percentiles are used when comparing the growth of children to the population and in the results of standardized tests, such as the SAT test. If a person scored in the 83rd percentile, that means they scored higher than 83% of the people who took the test.    Comparing Distributions  Box plots and percentiles are particularly useful for comparing data from two populations.    The box plots of service times for two fast-food restaurants are shown below. Compare the length of time to get served at the two restaurants. Which one should you go to if you are in a hurry?      The boxplot for Store 1 shows a 5-number summary of 0.7, 1.8, 2.3, 2.9, 6.3 minutes. The boxplot for Store 2 shows a 5-number summary of 0.5, 1.1, 2.1, 5.7, 9.6 minutes.    Store 2 has a slightly shorter median service time (2.1 minutes vs. 2.3 minutes), but the service times are less consistent, with a wider spread of the data.  The 75th percentiles are 2.9 and 5.7 minutes. That means at store 1, 75% of customers were served within 2.9 minutes, while at store 2, 75% of customers were served within 5.7 minutes.  Which store should you go to in a hurry? That depends upon your opinion about luck – 25% of customers at store 2 had to wait between 5.7 and 9.6 minutes.      The boxplots below show the 5-number summaries of the birth weights, in kilograms, of infants with severe idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome (SIRDS) van Vliet, P.K. and Gupta, J.M. (1973) Sodium bicarbonate in idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome. Arch. Disease in Childhood, 48, 249–255. As quoted on . The boxplots are separated to show the birth weights of infants who survived and those that did not. What can we conclude from this data?      The boxplot for infants who survived shows a 5-number summary of approximately 1.2, 1.8, 2.2, 2.9, 3.7 kg. The boxplot for infants who died shows a 5-number summary of 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 2.2, 2.8 kg.    Comparing the two groups, the boxplot reveals that the birth weights of the infants that died appear to be, overall, smaller than the weights of infants that survived. In fact, we can see that the median birth weight of infants that survived is about the same as the third quartile of the infants that died. Similarly, we can see that the 25th percentile of the survivors is larger than the 50th percentile of those that died, meaning that over 75% of the survivors had a birth weight larger than the median birth weight of those that died.  Similarly, looking at the maximum value for those that died and the third quartile of the survivors, we can see that over 25% of the survivors had birth weights higher than the heaviest infant that died. The box plots give us a quick, though informal, way to determine that birth weight is quite likely linked to the survival of infants with SIRDS.      Z-Scores  Have you ever heard the saying that you can't compare apples and oranges? It turns out that you can - provided we standardize their measures first!  We will be using the standard score called a Z-score, which is a method commonly used with unimodal and symmetric distributions (called normal or nearly normal distributions ). Z-scores may be used with any data, but if the distribution is skewed, then the distribution of Z-scores will also be skewed.  To calculate the Z-score for a data value, we find out how far away from the mean it is by subtracting. Then we divide by the standard deviation to see how many standard deviations that is. Thus, the Z-score of a data value is the number of standard deviations it is away from the mean.   Z-score     Be sure to calculate the difference first, then divide   If a data value is above the mean, its Z-score will be positive. If a data value is below the mean, its Z-score will be negative. Therefore, if a data value is one standard deviation above the mean, its Z-score is +1. If it is 2.5 standard deviations below the mean, its Z-score is -2.5. Note that the units of Z-scores are standard deviations, not the units of the data values.  We can use Z-scores to determine the relative unusualness of a data value with respect to its own distribution. That is what allows us to compare two unlike items. The convention in statistics is to say that a data value is unusual if it is more than 2 standard deviations from the mean, or in other words, if its Z-score is less than -2 or greater than +2.   The oranges at a local grocery store have a mean diameter of 5.8 inches and a standard deviation of 1.2 inches. The apples, on the other hand, have a mean diameter of 4.2 inches and a standard deviation of 0.6 inches.  Ali closes their eyes and selects and apple and an orange. When they look at both pieces of fruit, they seem small. If the orange has a diameter of 4.2 inches and the apple has a diameter of 3.5 inches, which is smaller relative to their respective piles of fruit?  To determine which fruit is relatively smaller, Ali can find each of their Z-scores.     By convention, Z-scores are rounded to two decimal places, so we see that the orange is 1.33 standard deviations below its mean and the apple is 1.17 standard deviation below its mean. The orange is therefore smaller relative to its distribution since its Z-score is less than the apple's Z-score.  We can also see from the Z-scores that neither fruit has an unusually small diameter since each piece of fruit is less than 2 standard deviations from its mean.  We can also find Z-scores using a spreadsheet with this formula:   =STANDARDIZE(data value, mean, standard deviation)   To verify our apple and orange Z-scores, we would write:   Apple: =STANDARDIZE(4.2, 5.8, 1.2) and we get -1.33 standard deviations   a screenshot of a spreadsheet showing the =STANDARDIZE formula.     Orange: =STANDARDIZE (3.5, 4.2, 0.6) and we get -1.17 standard deviations   a screenshot of a spreadsheet showing the =STANDARDIZE formula.      The mean weight of men over the age of 20 is 195.7 pounds 2016 CDC Report. . The study included all ethnicities but the report does not say whether transgendered men were included. with a standard deviation of 29.8 pounds. The mean weight of domestic cats is 8.6 pounds with a standard deviation of 1.2 pounds. (The standard deviation for men's weights is estimated. The cat's mean weight is based on ideal cat weight and the standard deviation is approximate).  At his peak, Andre the Giant, the 7-foot-4-inch French professional wrestler and actor, weighed 520 pounds. When Georgie the cat was at his peak he weighed 24 pounds. Who was more giant – Andre the Giant or Georgie the cat?  Since the weights of cats and men cannot be compared directly, we will need to calculate the Z-scores.     Using the standardize function, we would write:   Andre: =STANDARDIZE (520, 197.5, 29.8) which gives us 10.88 standard deviations.  Georgie: =STANDARDIZE (24, 8.6, 1.2) which gives us 12.83 standard deviations.   Since both Z-scores are greater than 2 standard deviations, both weights are extremely unusual. However, since the Z-score for Georgie's weight is larger, he is even more giant than Andre the Giant.     Exercises   Many of the datasets from the Measures of Center section are repeated here so you can use your previous work to help you.    A group of diners were asked how much they would pay for a breakfast in dollars.

Estimate the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles for CPA and actuary salaries.    Deshawn makes the median salary for an actuary. Kelsey makes the first quartile salary for a CPA. Who makes more money? How much more?    What percentage of actuaries make more than the median salary of a CPA?    What percentage of CPAs earn less than all actuaries?    The boxplot for CPA salary shows a 5-number summary of 30, 40, 75, 90, 100 in thousand dollars. The boxplot for Actuary salary shows a 5-number summary of 40, 75, 90, 94, 110 in thousand dollars           The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles are, respectively, the 1st quartile, median, and 3rd quartile for the data sets. Reading the boxplot for CPAs, the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for CPAs' salaries are, respectively, $40,000, $75,000, and $90,000. Reading the boxplot for actuaries, the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for actuaries' salaries are, respectively, $75,000, $90,000, and $94,000    Deshawn's salary (the median salary for an actuary) is $90,000; Kelsey's salary (the first quartile salary) is also $75,000. So Deshawn makes more than Kelsey, by $15,000.    75% of actuaries make more than the median salary of a CPA ($75,000).    25% of all CPAs earn less than all actuaries.       Fifty juniors and fifty seniors at a local high school were surveyed to find out how many hours per week they spend studying. The side-by-side boxplots the weekly study times for those high school juniors and seniors.    The boxplot of weekly study time for seniors shows a 5-number summary of 4, 5.5, 6, 9, 14 hours. The boxplot of weekly study time for juniors shows a 5-number summary of 0, 1, 3, 4, 6 hours       Estimate the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for weekly study time for high school juniors and seniors.    Olivia studies the maximum number of weekly study hours for a junior. Lucy studies the first quartile weekly study time for a senior. Who studies more, and by how many hours?    What percentage of juniors study between the minimum and median weekly study times for seniors?    What percentage of seniors study more than the third quartile weekly study time for juniors?         The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for weekly study times for the juniors are 1 hour, 3 hours, and 4 hours, respectively. The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for weekly study times the seniors are 5.5 hours, 6 hours, and 9 hours.    Olivia studies more each week than Lucy, by 30 minutes.    50% of juniors study between the minimum and median number of hours for seniors.    100% of seniors study more than the third quartile weekly study time for juniors.       Suppose you buy a new car whose advertised gas mileage is 25 mpg (miles per gallon). After driving the car for several months, you find that you are getting only 21.4 mpg. You phone the manufacturer and learn that the standard deviation of gas mileage for cars of that model is 1.15 mpg.   Find the Z-score for the gas mileage of your car.    Does it appear that your car is getting unusually low gas mileage? Explain your answer using your Z-score.              The -score for the gas mileage of the car is -3.13 standard deviations.       According to a local marathon club, the mean finishing time for a marathon is 274 minutes, with a standard deviation of 63 minutes.     If I can run a marathon with a finishing time of 170 minutes, find the Z-score for my marathon time.    Is my marathon finishing time of 170 minutes unusually fast? Explain your answer using the Z-score.            The marathon time's -score is -1.65 standard deviations.    Because the marathon finishing time is within 2 standard deviations of the mean finishing time, no, this marathon finishing time is not usually fast.       This data set is a sample of the average number of hours per year that a driver is delayed by road congestion in 11 cities:     56  53  53  50  46  45  44  43  42  40  36        Find the mean and the standard deviation, including units.    What is the Z-score for the city with an average delay time of 42 hours per year?         In GeoGebra:  In GeoGebra Classic, enter the data values into the column A of the spreadsheet and use the One Variable Analysis function. Then use the Show Statistics option to find the mean and standard deviation.  The mean is 46.2 hours per year, and the standard deviation is 6.16 hours per year.       The -score for a city with an average delay time of 42 hours per year is -0.68 standard deviations.       In a survey of 12 companies recruiting for recent college graduates, they reported the following numbers of job applicants per job posting:     123  123  134  127  115  122  125  101  130  143  110  122        Find the mean and standard deviation, including units.

In GeoGebra:  In GeoGebra Classic, enter the data values into the column A of the spreadsheet and use the One Variable Analysis function. Then use the Show Statistics option to find the mean and standard deviation.  The mean is 122.9 job applicants per job posting, and the standard deviation is 10.91 job applicants per job posting.       The -score for a company with 143 job applicants per job posting is 1.84 standard deviations       You scored an 89 on a math test where the class mean and standard deviation are 75 points and 7 points respectively. You scored a 65 on an English test where the mean and standard deviation are 53 points and 4 points, respectively. In which class did you do better? Explain your answer using Z-scores.         Because the -score of my English test is greater than the -score of my math test, I did better on the English test than I did on the math test.    The mean running time for comedy movies is 139 minutes, with a standard deviation of 39.7 minutes. For action movies, the mean running time is 159 minutes, with a standard deviation of 26.2 minutes. A recent comedy movie had a running time of 102 minutes, while an action movie playing at the same theatre had a running time of 129 minutes. Which movie is shorter compared to other movies in the same genre? Explain your answer using Z-score.         Because the -score for the 129 minute action movie was less than the -score for the 102 comedy movie, the action movie was shorter than the comedy movie, when both movies are compared to other movies in their genres.    Poe, the Clydesdale horse has a world record breaking height of 20.2 hands. All Clydesdale horses have a mean height of 16.5 hands and a standard deviation of 1.85 hands. The last Great Dane to hold the world record for dog height was Gibson who was 107 cm tall. Great Danes have a mean height of 81 cm and a standard deviation of 13 cm. Which animal is taller compared to their respective breed? Explain your answer using Z-scores.         Because the -scores for the heights of Poe (the Clydesdale horse) and Gibson (the Great Dane) are the same, neither animal is taller than the other when compared to their respective breeds.    "

Comparing the two groups, the boxplot reveals that the birth weights of the infants that died appear to be, overall, smaller than the weights of infants that survived. In fact, we can see that the median birth weight of infants that survived is about the same as the third quartile of the infants that died. Similarly, we can see that the 25th percentile of the survivors is larger than the 50th percentile of those that died, meaning that over 75% of the survivors had a birth weight larger than the median birth weight of those that died.  Similarly, looking at the maximum value for those that died and the third quartile of the survivors, we can see that over 25% of the survivors had birth weights higher than the heaviest infant that died.

By convention, Z-scores are rounded to two decimal places, so we see that the orange is 1.33 standard deviations below its mean and the apple is 1.17 standard deviation below its mean. The orange is therefore smaller relative to its distribution since its Z-score is less than the apple's Z-score.  We can also see from the Z-scores that neither fruit has an unusually small diameter since each piece of fruit is less than 2 standard deviations from its mean.  We can also find Z-scores using a spreadsheet with this formula:   =STANDARDIZE(data value, mean, standard deviation)   To verify our apple and orange Z-scores, we would write:   Apple: =STANDARDIZE(4.2, 5.8, 1.2) and we get -1.33 standard deviations   a screenshot of a spreadsheet showing the =STANDARDIZE formula.

Georgie: =STANDARDIZE (24, 8.6, 1.2) which gives us 12.83 standard deviations.   Since both Z-scores are greater than 2 standard deviations, both weights are extremely unusual.

Observational    Experiment       For the clinical trial of a migraine drug, subjects were randomly divided into two groups. The first received an inert pill, while the second received the test medicine. Patients were not aware of which group they were in. After one month, patients reported how many migraines they experienced.     Which is the treatment group?    Which is the control group (if there is one)?

This is a placebo-controlled experiment.       In a recent study , 380 high risk adolescents involved in the juvenile justice system were recruited to test an app designed to increase mindfulness and reduce substance use. Participants were randomly and equally assigned to use the app (Rewire) or receive services as usual from the Department of Youth Services. Participants were assessed to determine a baseline for substance use at the beginning of the study, and were asked to complete follow up assessments after 1 and 3 months. Assessments consisted of online surveys asking about substance use, emotion regulation, family demographics, and mindfulness practices. Urine samples were collected at each interview to verify self-reported substance use.     Describe the treatment group.    Describe the control group (if there is one).    Is this study blind, double-blind, or neither? Explain    Is this best described as an experiment, a controlled experiment, or a placebo-controlled experiment?

Round to two decimal places and include units.    Based on the mean and median, would you expect the distribution to be symmetric, skewed left, or skewed right? Explain.    Find the standard deviation. Round to two decimal places and include units.    Calculate the z-scores for the responses of $3.25 per gallon and $8.95 per gallon. Are either of these values unusual?    Determine the 5-number summary for the data.    What is the range and IQR of the data set? Round to two decimal places and include units.    Use the 5-number summary to construct a box plot.         The mean is $4.78 per gallon. The median is $4.75 per gallon.    The mean and median is about the same value therefore the data is symmetric.    The standard deviation is $1.34 per gallon.

Round to one decimal place if necessary.    Find the median of the data. Round to one decimal place if necessary.    Just comparing the mean and the median, do you expect the distribution to be skewed left, skewed right, or symmetric. Explain.    Find the standard deviation of the data. Round to one decimal place if needed.    Explain what the mean and standard deviation tell you about the sampled test scores.    Is the score of 99 unusual? Use z-scores to support your claim.    Find the 5-number summary.    Use the 5-number summary to create a box plot.    Create a histogram of the data. Start your scale at 0, and use a bin size of 10.    Describe the shape of the distribution. Be sure to address all three characteristics (modality, symmetry, and outliers).         The mean is about 78.9.    The median is 78.    The mean is greater than the median therefore the data is left skewed.    The standard deviation is about 14.5.    The majority of values are between 64.4 and 93.4.     . This 99 is only 1.39 standard deviations above the mean. This is not unusual. Generally, a value should be more than three deviations above or below the mean to be considered unusual.

What is the median number of goals for Team A? Team B?    What percentage of the goals for Team B is more than the maximum number of Team A?    What Team data is more symmetric?    What is the shape of the distribution for Team B?         The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile for Team A goals are 2, 4, and 5, respectively.  The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile for Team B goals are 6, 8, and 9, respectively.    The Median for Team A is 4.  The Median for Team B is 8.    Fifty percent of the goals for Team B exceed the maximum number for goals for Team A.    The data for Team A is more symmetric than for Team B.    The data for Team B is skewed left.       Suppose you buy a new car whose advertised gas mileage is 35 mpg (miles per gallon). After driving the car for several months, you find that you are getting only 30.4 mpg. You phone the manufacturer and learn that the standard deviation for that model is 1.35 mpg.     Find the z-score for the gas mileage of your car.    Does it appear that your car is getting unusually low gas mileage? Explain your answer using your z-score.              30.4 mpg is 3.41 standard deviations below the mean so the car is getting unusually low gas mileage.       This data set is a sample of the average number of minutes per week that a driver is delayed by road congestion in 13 cities:     66  55  53  50  36  45  34  43  52  40  76  45  63        Find the mean and the standard deviation, including units.    What is the z-score for the city with an average delay time of 42 hours per week?    Is an average delay time of 42 hours per week unusual? Explain using the calculated z-score.         The mean is approximately 50.6 minutes per week. The standard deviation approximately 12.2 minutes per week.         42 minutes per week is 0.70 standard deviations below the mean, so it is not unusual.      "

You might be familiar with it as the bell curve . When we take measurements like the lengths of newborn babies or the weights of potato chip bags on an assembly line there are usually more measurements near the mean and fewer as we get further away from the mean on each side. We often see histograms with this shape:    A histogram where the bars form a bell shape. A Normal curve is overlaid on the histogram.    Notice how the shape is unimodal and symmetric with larger and smaller values getting less and less common as they get further from the mean. When we take samples from a population we might not get an exact Normal distribution but it is often close. We call this approximately Normal or nearly Normally distributed. The curve drawn over the histogram shows that the data are nearly Normal. Earlier in this chapter we learned about the mean , median and mode as measures of center and the standard deviation as a measure of variation or spread. The mean is often written with the greek letter mu, . The standard deviation is usualy represented by the lowercase Greek letter sigma, .    Properties of the Normal Distribution  Regardless of the data values, the Normal distribution has these properties:   The shape is unimodal and symmetric around the center.    The mean, median and mode are approximately the same value in the center.    Due to the symmetry, approximately 50% of the data values are below the mean, and approximately 50% of the data values are above the mean.    A normal curve with a line drawn in the middle to indicate the mean, median and mode. The drawing shows that 50% of the data values are below the line and 50% are above the line.      Almost all of the area under a Normal curve is within 3 standard deviations of the mean, so we use the standard deviation as our scale.    Data within two standard deviations of the mean are considered typical or usual. Data beyond two standard deviation are considered unusual. Data beyond 3 standard deviations are considered rare.     Now let's look at an example where we draw and label a Normal distribution given the mean and standard deviation All of the Normal drawings in this section were created with the online probability calculator at which is in the public domain. .   The test scores on a math quiz are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 18 points and a standard deviation of 4 points. Draw the Normal distribution and label the axis using the standard deviation.    A normal curve with the mean of 18 points labeled in the middle. To the right, 3 standard deviations are labeled 22, 26 and 30 points. To the left 3 standard deviations are labeled 14, 10 and 6 points.    We start by drawing a Normal curve and the horizontal axis. Then we place the mean of 18 points in the center of the graph and make 3 marks on each side, ending where the curve gets close to the axis.  Each mark represents one standard deviation. As we move to the right of the mean we will add the standard deviation of 4 points to get 22, 26 and 30 points. These are the values that are 1, 2 and 3 standard deviations above the mean.     Then we move to the left of the mean we subtract the standard deviation of 4 from 18 to get 14, 10 and 6 points. These are the values that are 1, 2 and 3 standard deviations below the mean.        The Empirical Rule  No matter what the mean and standard deviation are for a Normal Distribution, they always have the same shape or distribution of the data. We can describe this with the Empirical Rule which is also called the 68-95-99.7 Rule .  The numbers in the 68-95-99.7 rule describe the percentage of data or area within 1, 2 and 3 standard deviations of the mean. Let's look at our previous example with scores on a math quiz that are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 18 points and a standard deviation of 4 points.   According to the Empirical rule, about 68% of all the data values fall within one standard deviation of the mean, or between 14 and 22 points.   A graph of a normal curve that shows 68% of the data values shaded within one standard deviation of the mean, in this case between 14 and 22 points.     About 95% of all the data values fall within two standard deviation, or between 10 and 26 points.   A graph of a normal curve that shows 95% of the data values shaded within two standard deviations of the mean, in this case between 10 and 26 points.     About 99.7% of all the data values fall within three standard deviations, or between 6 and 30 points.   A graph of a normal curve that show 99.7% of the data values shaded within 3 standard deviations of the mean, in this case between 6 and 30 points.    Now you can try this next example:    The weights of black lab dogs are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 78 pounds and a standard deviation of 7 pounds.   Draw and label a sketch of this distribution.    Use the Empirical Rule to complete following statements.   Approximately 68% of black labs weigh between and pounds.    Approximately 95% of black lab dogs weigh between and pounds.    Approximately 99.7% of black lab dogs weigh between and pounds.             We start by drawing the Normal curve and the horizontal axis, labeling 3 standard deviations on each side.   A normal curve labeled with 57, 64, 71, 78, 85, 92 and 99 pounds. The title of the graph is weights of black lab dogs in points.        Approximately 68% of black labs weigh between 71 and 85 pounds.    Approximately 95% of black labs weigh between 64 and 92 pounds.    Approximately 99.7% of black labs weigh between 57 and 99 points.            Using the Empirical Rule to Calculate Approximate Probabilities  Now that we have learned about the Empirical rule we can use it to find approximate probabilities. First we will calculate the percentage in each segment of the Normal distribution. Returning to our example of quiz scores with a mean of 18 points and a standard deviation of 4 points, we can divide the curve into segments by drawing a line at each standard deviation.    A normal curve labeled with 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26 and 30 points. The title is quiz scores in points. There is a line segment at each number listed to divide the curve into segments.    Now, since we know that approximately 68% of the values are between 14 and 22 points, and the graph is symmetric, we divide 68% by 2 to get: So each of the middle 2 segments are 34% of the area each.  Next, we know that 95% of the values fall within 2 standard deviations or between 10 and 26 points. That also includes the 68% though, so to get the area of the next two segments, we subtract: Then since there is one segment on each side, we divide that by 2: So the next two segments from the mean are 13.5% each.  Continuing outward, 99.7% of the values fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean or between 6 and 30 points. Since that includes the 95% we subtract: Then we divide that by 2: So the next two segments outward are 2.35% each.  Finally, there is one more set, since there is a tiny percentage outside of the 3 standard deviations. The total is 100% so we subtract: Then we divide that by 2: So the last two outer segments are 0.15% each.  We can summarize all the calculations in this drawing:    The previous normal curve with the area of each segment filled in. From left to right the areas are 0.15%, 2.35%, 13.5%, 34%, 34%, 13.5%, 2.35%, 0.15%.    Now let's continue our quiz score example to see how to use the Empirical Rule to find probabilities.   For the quiz score data that are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 18 points and a standard deviation 4 points, use the 68-95-99.7% rule to calculate the following probabilities:     What percentage of students earned scores between 22 and 30 points?    What percentage of students earned scores above 14 points?    What percentage of students earned a score below 14 or above 22 points?     Solution   Using the diagram above, we add the two segments between 22 and 30 to get . 15.8% percent of students earned scores between 22 and 30 points on the quiz.    We add all the segments above 14 to get . 84% of students earned scores above 14 points on the quiz.    We add all the segments below 14 and above 22 to get . 32% of students earned scores below 14 or above 22 points on the quiz. Notice we could have done this in a faster way by taking . There can be more than one way to get the answer.      Now you can try one with this next example.    Continuing with the black lab dogs whose weights are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 78 pounds and a standard deviation 7 pounds, use the 68-95-99.7% rule to calculate the following probabilities:     What percentage of black labs weigh between 78 and 92 pounds?    What percentage of black labs weigh below 71 points?    What percentage of black labs weigh below 64 or above 78 points?       First we need to draw this distribution and label three standard deviations on each side of the mean to determine where these weights fall. That will tell us which segments to add up. Here is our drawing of this distribution from before.   The previous normal curve of weights of black lab dogs in pounds. The scale at the bottom is 57, 64, 71, 78, 85, 92, 99 pounds.      Using this Normal curve along with the diagram above we see we need to add the two segments between 78 and 92 pounds to get . 47.5% percent of black labs weigh between 78 and 92 pounds.    We add all the segments below 71 pounds to get . 16% of black labs weigh below 71 pounds.    We add all the segments below 64 and above 78 pounds to get . 52.5% of black labs weigh below 64 or above 78 pounds. Notice we could have done this in a faster way since 78 is the mean we know the percentage above the mean is 50%. We could have added .         Using Technology to Calculate Exact Probabilities  The Empirical rule is used to find approximate probabilities and it only works if the number is one of the labels on our scale. We usually want to calculate an exact answer with any value. We will use technology to calculate probabilities with two different methods: Onlinestatbook.com and spreadsheets . Check with your class notes or instructor on which technology to use.   To use Onlinestatbook.com, go to the OnlineStatbook Normal calculator and enter the mean and standard deviation. Then select the option that matches the probability you want to find: Above, Below, Between or Outside and enter the probability you want to find. Then click on the Recalculate button.   A screenshot of the onlinestatbook.com normal probability calculator. It shows a normal curve, an input box for the mean and median, and a choice to find above, below, between or outside.    To use a spreadsheet, we will use the spreadsheet formula   =NORM.DIST(value, mean, standard deviation, cumulative)   This function always gives the probability to the left of a number or . We can use this formula to find greater than, between and outside probabilities as well. Here are the commands we will use and we will explain them in the next example with visuals.    Probability  Spreadsheet Formula    Below  =NORM.DIST(value, mean, SD, 1)    Above  =1-NORM.DIST(value, mean, SD,1)    Between  =NORM.DIST(upper_value, mean, SD, 1)-Norm.Dist(lower_value, mean, SD, 1)    Outside  =NORM.DIST(lower_value, mean, SD, 1)+1-NORM.DIST(upper_value,mean, SD, 1)     For the quiz score data that are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 18 points and a standard deviation 4 points, use technology to calculate the following probabilities:     What percentage of students earned a score below 12 points?    What percentage of students earned scores above 27 points?    What percentage of students earned scores between 21 and 25 points?    What percentage of students earned scores less than 11 or more than 23?     Solution     First, using OnlineStatbook, we we will enter the mean of 18 points and the standard deviation of 4 points. Then we select Below and enter 12. This gives us a result of as shown in the image or .  To use a spreadsheet, we enter =NORM.DIST(12, 18, 4, 1) . The last value is always a 1 to indicate that we want a cumulative probability or area. This also gives us a result of or .    A screenshot of onlinestatbook showing the inputs and output described above.        To use OnlineStatbook, we we will keep our mean of 18 points and standard deviation of 4 points. Then we select Above and enter 27. This gives us a result of as shown in the image or .  To use a spreadsheet, NORM.DIST gives us the area to the left so if we want the area to the right we need to find the complement or subtract from 1. We enter =1-NORM.DIST(27, 18, 4, 1) . This also gives us a result of or .    A screenshot of onlinestatbook showing the inputs and output described above.       To use OnlineStatbook, we we will keep our mean of 18 points and standard deviation of 4 points. Then we select Between and enter 21 and 25. This gives us a result of as shown in the image or .

We can find the area to the left of the upper value and then subtract the area to the left of the lower value. That will give us the area between the two values. We enter =NORM.DIST(25, 18, 4, 1)-NORM.DIST(21, 18, 4, 1) . This also gives us a result of or .     To use OnlineStatbook, we we will keep our mean of 18 points and standard deviation of 4 points.

To use a spreadsheet, we will find the left and right probabilities and add them together. We enter =NORM.DIST(11, 18, 4, 1)+1-NORM.DIST(23, 18, 4, 1) . This also gives us a result of or .      Now you can this try this example.    Continuing with the black lab dogs whose weights are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 78 pounds and a standard deviation 7 pounds, use technology to calculate the following probabilities:     The probability that a randomly chosen black lab weighs at least 95 pounds.    The probability that a randomly chosen black lab weighs less than 72 pounds.    The probability that a black lab weighs less than 65 pounds or greater than 86 pounds.    The probability that a black lab weighs between 66 and 75.          Using OnlineStatbook and\/or =1-NORM.DIST(95, 78, 7, 1) we get or .    Using OnlineStatbook and\/or =NORM.DIST(72, 78, 7, 1) we get or .    Using OnlineStatbook and\/or =NORM.DIST(65, 78, 7, 1)+1-NORM.DIST(86, 78, 7, 1) we get or .    Using OnlineStatbook and\/or =NORM.DIST(75, 78, 7, 1)-NORM.DIST(66, 78, 7, 1) we get or .         The Standard Normal Distribution and Z-Scores  Earlier in the chapter we learned how to calculate a Z-score , which is a way to determine how usual or unusual a data value is, or compare values from two different distributions. To calculate the Z-score for a data value, we calculate its distance from the mean. Then we divide that distance by the standard deviation to see how many standard deviations that is. Thus, the Z-score of a data value is the number of standard deviations it is away from the mean.   Z-score     Be sure to calculate the difference first, then divide.   If a data value is equal to the mean it will have a Z-score of 0. If a data value is one standard deviation above the mean, it will have a Z-score of 1. We can make a Normal distribution of Z-scores and it will have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is called the Standard Normal distribution , shown below.    A normal curve labeled with -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 standard deviations. The title is Z-scores. There is a line at each number dividing the curve into segments.    Applying the Empirical Rule in percentage form to the Standard Normal curve looks like this.    The previous normal curve with the area of each segment filled in. From left to right the areas are 0.15%, 2.35%, 13.5%, 34%, 34%, 13.5%, 2.35%, 0.15%.    Sometimes we may want to use the decimal form of the numbers instead.    The previous normal curve with the area of each segment filled in in decimal form. From left to right the areas are 0.0015, 0.0235, 0.135, 0.34, 0.34, 0.135, 0.0235, 0.0015.    Applying the Empirical Rule to the Standard Normal distribution, we know that 68% of all Z-scores will be between -1 and 1, 95% of all Z-scores will be between -2 and 2 and 99.7% of all Z-scores will be between -3 and 3. A Z-score below -3 or above 3 is possible, but is very unlikely.   Let's say a student scored 27 points on the math quiz where the scores were approximately normally distributed with a mean of 18 points and a standard deviation of 4 points. We know from our earlier drawing that they scored between 2 and 3 standard deviations above the mean. Let's calculate the Z-score to determine exactly how many standard deviations from the mean they scored.  First we take the data value and subtract the mean of 18, then we divide by the standard deviation of 4 points: . The Z-score is positive so which confirms that they scored above the mean.     Now you can calculate the Z-score for a student who scored 15 on the math quiz.    First we take the data value and subtract the mean of 18, then we divide by the standard deviation of 4 points: . This student scored 0.75 standard deviations below the mean. The Z-score is negative which means they scored below the mean.      Confidence Intervals and Margin of Error  Now that we have learned more about the Normal distribution, we can come back to confidence intervals which we studied in section 3.1. When we take a sample, our goal is to infer our statistic to the larger population. Let's say we wanted to know the average height of all 10-year-old kids living in the United States. It would take too much time and money to measure them all so we take a random sample that is representative of the population of 10-year-olds.  If we measured 25 randomly selected 10-year-olds and calculated the sample mean of 54.5 inches, that statistic is called a point estimate . It is a single value that we got from a sample. However, if we measured another random sample of 25 different kids we would likely get a different mean. That is called sampling variation or sampling error. To be more accurate in our estimation of the height of all 10-year olds we give a range of values called a confidence interval .  To construct a confidence interval we need to know the point estimate, the standard error of the data and the desired confidence level. The standard error is an estimate for the standard deviation that we calculate from the sample data and the sample size. You can learn more details about sampling distributions, why they are Normally distributed and how to calculate the standard error in a statistics course.  The most common confidence level is the 95% confidence level. The 95% confidence interval represents the middle 95% of the Normal curve. From the Empirical rule we saw that approximately 95% of the data values are within 2 standard deviations of the mean. Using more exact methods, the middle 95% is 1.96 standard deviations from the mean.    A normal curve showing the middle 95% of the area shaded, which is 1.96 standard deviations on each side of the mean of 0.    Let's say that our point estimate for the height of 10-year-olds is 54.5 inches and the standard error is 1.75 inches. To estimate the middle 95% of values we multiply the standard error by 1.96 standard deviations.     To find the lower boundary of the confidence interval we subtract   To find the upper boundary of the confidence interval add .  The 95% confidence interval is 51.07 to 57.93 inches or (51.07, 57.93) inches.  To interpret a confidence interval we say: We are 95% confident that the true average height of all 10-year-olds is between 51.07 and 57.93 inches. This means if repeated samples were taken and the 95% confidence interval was computed for each sample, about 95% of the intervals would contain the true population mean. About five percent of the intervals would not contain the population mean.  The standard error multiplied by the number of standard deviations for the confidence level is called the margin of error . In this example we have  . The margin of error is the range of values below and above your sample mean in the confidence interval.  Since the point estimate is our best guess for the value of the parameter, it makes sense to build the confidence interval around that value. The standard error, which is the measure of the uncertainty associated with the point estimate, provides a guide for how large we should make the confidence interval. When the sampling distribution of a point estimate can reasonably be modeled as Normal, the point estimate we observe will be within 1.96 standard errors of the true value of interest. We can be 95% confident this interval captures the true value.  The idea behind confidence intervals and margin of error is that any survey, study or poll will always be different from the population because samples vary. The confidence interval and margin of error reflect the sample size and the variation in the sample.    Exercises   Describe the shape of a Normal distribution.   The shape of a Normal distribution is unimodal, symmetric and bell-shaped.

The median tree diameter is approximately 35 inches.    Two Normal distributions have the same means but different standard deviations. Distribution A has a standard deviation of 10 inches, and distribution B has a standard deviation of 15 inches. Which curve has a wider spread along the horizontal axis? Why?   Distribution B has a wider spread because it has a larger standard deviation.     Use the Empirical Rule to answer these questions.

We know from our earlier drawing that they scored between 2 and 3 standard deviations above the mean. Let's calculate the Z-score to determine exactly how many standard deviations from the mean they scored.  First we take the data value and subtract the mean of 18, then we divide by the standard deviation of 4 points: . The Z-score is positive so which confirms that they scored above the mean.  "

  "body": " Introduction to Spreadsheets   Introduction to Spreadsheets   Students will be able to:     Perform basic calculations on a spreadsheet    Use cell references and the fill-down feature      A spreadsheet such as Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel, is a very useful tool for doing calculations and making complex tables. You can type in your own custom calculations or use the built-in formulas.  The rectangles within a spreadsheet are called cells , and they can be referenced by their column letter and row number. The first cell in the upper left side highlighted below is A1. If we wanted to talk about the third column and the fifth row, that cell would be C5.    A blank spreadsheet with the cell A1 highlighted    A spreadsheet file can contain many sheets. Look along the bottom to see if there is more than one sheet and make sure you are on the right sheet.    A blank spreadsheet showing the sheet tabs at the bottom of the screen.      Basic Calculations  To do a calculation on a spreadsheet, type an equal sign before the operation. This lets the program know that you want it to calculate the result. When you press enter, you will see the result.       To add 3 + 4, enter =3+4     To subtract 100-76, enter =100-76     To multiply 4 times 18, enter =4*18     To divide 0.05 by 12, enter =0.05\/12     To calculate , enter =5^25       A spreadsheet showing the examples entered in the spreadsheet. cell A1 has =3+4, cell A2 has =100-76, cell A3 has =4*18, cell A4 has =0.05\/12 and cell A5 has =5^25.     Note that the asterisk (*) is used for multiplication. Spreadsheets don't recognize parentheses as indicators of multiplication like calculators do, so even if you have parentheses for the order of operations, the asterisk is also needed.  You can make more complicated mathematical expressions using parentheses and other operations. To edit a cell click on the editing box at the top, or double click on the cell to edit it directly.    Your bill at a restaurant is $35.75 and you want to leave an 18% tip. How much would you add to the bill?    To work with a percentage, we need to convert it into a decimal first, and then multiply it by the base amount.  In a spreadsheet we would type =0.18*35.75   and get a result of $6.44, rounded to the nearest cent . You would leave a tip of $6.44.      Cell References  One of the powerful things about spreadsheets is using a cell reference, such as C5 in a calculation. When you use a cell reference , the values will automatically update if any of the referenced values change.  Let's make a spreadsheet for the percentage tip example above. We calculated an 18% tip on a bill of $35.75. We might want to tip 18% in general, but our bill will change values. We labeled the first column Bill Amount and the second column Tip. The amount of $35.75 is entered in cell A2. Then when we write our formula in B2, we want to calculate 18% of A2. That way if the number in A2 changes, our tip will automatically update.    A spreadsheet showing a formula with a cell reference, =0.18*A2    The formula =0.18*A2 is entered in B2 which gives a result of $6.44 when you hit enter.    The same spreadsheet showing when the input in A1 is changed to $45, the answer to the formula changes to $8.10.    When the bill amount is changed, the tip is recalculated.    Cell Formatting  We can also format cells A1 and B1 to show dollar signs by clicking on the dollar sign in the number formatting menu.    Fill-Down Feature  The fill-down feature is very useful for making tables. This allows us to copy values or formulas to save time. Let's make a tipping reference table with values from $10, to$100, in increments of $10. First, we will enter two values in column A to establish the pattern. Then select those two cells and you will see a small square in the lower right corner. Drag that square down until you get to $100.    A spreadsheet showing the fill-down feature; cells A2 and A3 are highligted for the pattern and there is a down arrow by the small square to drag down.      This spreadsheet shows the completed bill amount column from $10 to $100 and shows the fill-down feature for the formula; cell B2 has the equation =0.18*A2 and there is a down arrow by the small square to drag down.    Next, we can drag our formula down and the cell reference will change to each row number automatically.  Here are the formulas with the row numbers updated:    This spreadsheet shows the result of filling down the formula. The cell reference changes for each new row.    Here is our completed table with the calculations:    This spreadsheet shows the calculated values for tips from $10-100.      Formulas  Spreadsheets have many useful built-in formulas. We will introduce some of the financial formulas in this chapter. Here are some of the formulas we will use:    =FV to calculate the future values of an investment     =PV to calculate the deposit needed for a desired future balance     =PMT to calculate a loan or savings plan payment     =EFFECT to calculate the effective rate of an account and compare accounts     In the rest of this chapter we will use spreadsheets and formulas to calculate the future values, interest paid or earned and monthly payments.    Exercises   Use a spreadsheet to compute the following.    Convert to a decimal    =4\/7 which gives approximately 0.571429    Convert 16% to a decimal    =16% which gives 0.16    Add 8 and 19    =8+19 which gives 27    Find the difference of 230 and 78    =230-78 which gives 152    Multiply 12 and 9    =12*9 which gives 108    Divide 0.09 by 52    =0.09\/52 which gives approximately 0.001731    Calculate     =8^3 which gives 512    Your bill at a restaurant is $55.75 and you want to leave a 20% tip. How much would you add to the bill?    =55.75*20% which gives $11.15    You leave a tip for $7.50 for a bill at a restaurant that is $44.50. What percent tip did you leave?    =7.50\/44.50 which gives approximately 0.1685, or approximately 16.85%    In Column A use the fill down feature to build a spreadsheet starting with $5 and ending at $125, in increments of $5. In Column B write a formula with a cell reference to calculate a 15.5% tip on the amount in Column A. Use the fill down feature to complete your table.   See the table below:  Note, the entry in cell B1 is =15%*A1 . (Columns A and B are given dollar formatting)    A portion of a spreadsheet is shown which includes cells A1 through B25, and with a title heading of Table 1. Cell A1 shows $5.00, cell A2 shows $10.00, and so on. The pattern shows that each additional cell under A1 is equal to the cell above it, plus $5.00. This pattern continues down to cell A25, which shows $125.00. Cell B1 shows $0.78, which is 15% of the $5.00 amount shown in cell A1. Cell B2 shows $1.55, which is 15% of the $10.00 amount shown in cell A2. This pattern continues until we reach cell B25, which shows $19.38, and which is 15% of the $125.00 amount shown in cell A25.      Imagine a certain savings account started out with a balance of $5250.00 on day-one, and today has a current balance of $5780.23     Exactly how much more money does the account have today, compared with day-one?    Rounding to the nearest tenth of a percent: By what percentage amount has the account balance grown?    If instead, the bank balance today was exactly double the starting balance, then by what exact percentage amount would the bank balance have grown?    If the bank balance today had instead grown by 15.5% since day-one, then what would be the exact amount of today's balance?          =5780.23-5250 which gives $530.23     =530.23\/5250 which gives approximately 0.100996, or approximately 10.1%    Exactly 200%     =5250*115.5% which gives exactly $6063.75       Imagine that at the start of a certain month, you will make an opening deposit of $500 into a savings account, and you will then leave the account alone (meaning you will make no further deposits or withdrawals). Also, for this account: Every month after the opening deposit, the amount in the account will grow to be 101% of its previous month's balance.     Use a spreadsheet to enter 500 in cell A1. Using a formula and a cell-reference: Compute in cell A2, the amount in the account after one month has passed. Then using the fill down feature, continue the pattern for another eleven full months (you should end at cell A13). Format all the cells to show dollar signs. What is the amount in the account after one year?    Now continue the pattern in column A of your spreadsheet to extend for a second full year (you should end at cell A25). What is the amount in the account after two years?    What overall percentage growth occurred in the account between the opening deposit and one year later? (Compute using a formula and cell references)    What overall percentage growth occurred in the account between the end of year one, and the end of year two? (Compute using a formula and cell references)    (Challenge) The annual percentage growth that you found in part (d) for the second year, should be identical to the annual percentage growth that you found in part (c) for the first year. Can you mathematically explain why this is true? Do you think this pattern of identical overall annual percentage growth would continue, if you extend the pattern for even more years?         See the table at the bottom for part a and part b.  After 1 year, the account holds $563.41.    See the table at the bottom for part a and part b.  After 2 years, the account holds $634.87.     =A13\/A1 which gives growth     =A25\/A13 which gives growth (same)    Each starting value increases mathematically by a factor of each year, which is approximately 112.6825%. So yes, this pattern must continue indefinitely into future years.       A portion of a spreadsheet is shown covering cells A1 through A25, and with a title heading of Table 2. Cell A1 shows $500.00. Cell A2 shows $505.00, which is 101% of cell A1. Cell A3 shows $510.05, which is 101% of cell A2. This pattern continues until we reach cell A25, which shows $634.87, and which is 101% of cell A24.      Imagine that at the start of a certain year, you will deposit $1000.00 into a savings account, and then you will leave the account alone. Each year after the opening deposit, the amount in the account will grow to be 103% of its previous year's balance.     After two years, the account balance will have experienced two growth amounts of 103%. You can find this account balance amount here, with the spreadsheet computation = 1000 * (103%) * (103%) . Perform this computation in a spreadsheet and write the balance that you find.    Now enter the spreadsheet computation = 1000 * (103%)^2 . Notice that the result here, which involves using a power, gives the same answer as you found in part (a). Comparing the two spreadsheet computations: Explain why they give the same result.    Using the pattern in part (b) above, and carefully choosing the power: Compute the balance that will be in the account fifteen full years after the account was originally opened. (Round to the nearest cent)    (Challenge) Make a spreadsheet that shows the account balance each individual year for 30 years. From the date of the opening deposit: What minimum number of full years will you have to wait, until the balance finally exceeds twice its opening deposit amount? (Use cell references, the fill down feature, and dollar formatting)    (Challenge) Imagine the opening balance of the account was $5000.00 instead of $1000.00 (and everything else about the account stays the same). Make a similar spreadsheet as you did in part (d), and using this spreadsheet, find the minimum number of full years you will have to wait this time, until the balance finally exceeds twice its opening deposit amount. How does this answer compare with your answer in part (d)? Do you think your answer would be the same here, for any positive opening balance you may choose for the account?          =1000*103%*103% which gives $1060.90     =1000*(103%)^2 gives the same result of $1060.90, because raising 103% to the second power means the same as multiplying 103% by itself two times.     =1000*(103%)^15 which gives $1557.97 rounded to the nearest cent    Refer to the table at the bottom for part d and part e.  Note the entry in cell B3 here is = B2*103% and the remaining cells are computed using the fill down feature.  You will have to wait a minimum of 24 full years, in each case, in order for the balance to finally exceed twice the opening deposit amount.    Since , the minimum number of full years until the opening deposit doubles must be the same here, for any positive opening balance that we may choose for this account.       A portion of a spreadsheet is shown, which includes cells A1 through E32, and with a title heading of Table 3. Cell A1 shows a column title of Year, and cells A2 through A32 contain values of 0 through 30, respectively. Cells D1 through D32 are a copy of cells A1 through A32. Cell B1 shows a column title of Balance. Cell B2 shows $1,000.00, which corresponds to Year 0 displaying in adjacent cell A1. Cell B3 shows $1,030.00, which is 103% of the $1,000 shown in cell B2. Cell B4 shows $1,060.90, which is 103% of the $1,030.00 shown in cell B3. This pattern continues until we get to cell B32, which shows $2,427.26, and which is 103% of the $2,356.57 amount shown in cell B31. Cell E1 shows a column title of Balance. Cell B2 shows $5,000.00, which corresponds to Year 0 displaying in adjacent cell D1. Cell E3 shows $5,150.00, which is 103% of the $5,000 shown in cell E2. Cell E4 shows $5,304.50, which is 103% of the $5,150.00 shown in cell E3. This pattern continues until we get to cell E32, which shows $12,136.31, and which is 103% of the $11,782.83 amount shown in cell E31.      "

  "body": " Simple and Compound Interest   Simple and Compound Interest   Students will be able to:     Use spreadsheet functions and\/or mathematical formulas to calculate simple, compound, and continuously compounded interest    Understand the difference between simple and compound interest    Use a spreadsheet to calculate the effective rate and compare accounts    Use a spreadsheet and\/or formula to calculate the present value needed to reach a desired future value       Note: Spreadsheets are emphasized in this chapter, but the formulas are also presented so you can understand what the spreadsheet is doing. Be sure to check with your instructor for which method to use.   Working with money is a very important skill for everyday life. While balancing a checkbook or calculating our monthly expenditures on espresso requires only arithmetic, when we start saving money, planning for retirement, or need a loan, we need more mathematics and tools. In this section we will calculate and compare simple and compound interest.   Alternative Video Lessons      Simple Interest  Calculating interest starts with the principal , P , or the beginning amount in your account. This is also called the present value . This could be a starting investment, or the starting amount of a loan. The interest rate , I , in its most simple form, is a percentage of the principal.  For example, if you borrowed $100 from a friend and agree to repay it with 5% interest, then the amount of interest you would pay would be 5% of 100. It is very important to remember to change the interest rate , r, of 5% into a decimal by moving the decimal two places to the left.     The total amount you would repay is called the future value and would be $105, the original principal plus the interest.     Here are the formulas to represent the calculations we just did.   Simple One-time Interest            is the interest     is the principal, starting amount or present value      is the interest rate in decimal form     is the end amount: principal plus interest. This is also called the future value         A friend asks to borrow $300 and agrees to repay it in 30 days with 3% simple interest. How much interest will you earn?     , the principal or present value   , 3% rate  Using the formula,     To calculate this in a spreadsheet, you would enter =300*0.03 and get a result of $9. You will earn $9 in interest when your friend pays you back.    One-time simple interest is only common for extremely short-term or informal loans. For longer term loans or investments, it is common for interest to be paid on a daily, monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. In that case, interest would be earned regularly. Bonds are an example of this type of investment. Bonds are issued by the federal, state or local governments to cover their expenses.    Suppose your city is building a new park, and issues bonds to raise the money to build it. You buy a $1,000 bond that pays 5% simple interest annually and matures in 5 years. How much interest will you earn? What is the future value of the bond?    Each year, you would earn 5% interest so over the course of five years, you would earn:     When the bond matures, you would receive back the $1,000 you originally paid and the $250 in interest, so we could also put that into a single calculation:     Using a spreadsheet, you would enter =1000+1000*0.05 and get a result of $1,250. The future value of the bond is $1,250.    We can generalize this idea of simple interest over time.   Simple Interest over Time            is the interest     is the principal, starting amount, or present value     is the interest rate in decimal form     is time, where the increment of time (years, months, etc.) matches the time period for the interest rate     is the end amount, principal plus interest, or future value        APR – Annual Percentage Rate  Interest rates are usually stated as an annual percentage rate (APR) – the total interest that will be paid in the year. If not stated otherwise, assume that the interest rate is an annual rate or APR. If the interest is paid in smaller time increments, the APR will be divided by the number of time periods.  Note: The Federal Truth in Lending Act requires that every consumer be given the true APR which includes the interest and any fees included.  For example, a 6% APR paid monthly, would be divided by 12, because you would get one twelfth of the rate per month, which is half a percent per month.     A 4% annual rate paid quarterly, would be divided by 4 to get 1% per quarter.     Here is an example of a semi-annual rate.    Suppose you buy a $1,000 federal bond with a 4% annual simple interest rate, paid semi-annually, with a maturity in 4 years. How much interest will you earn? What will be the future value of the bond?     , the principal   , interest is being paid semi-annually (twice a year), so the 4% interest will be divided into two 2% payments.   , 4 years compounded twice a year gives half-years     You will earn $160 in interest over the four years. The future value of the loan is     We could also use a spreadsheet to do this calculation and enter:   =1000+1000*(0.04\/2)*(4*2)   which also gives $1,160. The future value of the bond is $1,160. Remember that spreadsheets don't interpret parentheses as multiplication. We need the asterisks as well as the parentheses.      Compound Interest  In a standard bank account, any interest we earn is automatically added to our balance, and we earn interest on that interest. This reinvestment of interest is called compounding . We will develop the mathematical formula for compound interest and then show the equivalent spreadsheet function.  Suppose that we deposit $1000 in a bank account offering 3% interest, compounded monthly. How will our money grow?  The 3% interest is an annual percentage rate (APR) – the total interest to be paid during the year. Since interest is being paid monthly, each month, we will earn per month.  In the first month,     In the first month, we will earn $2.50 in interest, raising our account balance to $1002.50.  In the second month,     Notice that in the second month we earned more interest than we did in the first month. This is because we earned interest not only on the original $1000 we deposited, but we also earned interest on the $2.50 of interest we earned the first month. This is the key advantage that compounding gives us.  Calculating out a few more months in a table or a spreadsheet we have:    Month  Starting balance  Interest earned  Ending Balance    1  1000.00  2.50  1002.50    2  1002.50  2.51  1005.01    3  1005.01  2.51  1007.52    4  1007.52  2.52  1010.04    5  1010.04  2.53  1012.57    6  1012.57  2.53  1015.10    7  1015.10  2.54  1017.64    8  1017.64  2.54  1020.18    9  1020.18  2.55  1022.73    10  1022.73  2.56  1025.29    11  1025.29  2.56  1027.85    12  1027.85  2.56  1030.42    To find an equation to represent this, we will go through a few months to see the pattern:  Initial Amount:               Observing a pattern, we could conclude     Notice that the $1000 in the equation was P, the starting amount. We found 1.0025 by adding one to the interest rate divided by 12, since we were compounding 12 times per year. Generalizing our result, we could write   Compound Interest        A  is the future value balance in the account after years    P  is the principal or present value    r  is the annual interest rate in decimal form    n  is the number of compounding periods in one year    t  is the number of years      If the compounding is done annually (once a year), .  If the compounding is done quarterly, .  If the compounding is done monthly, .  If the compounding is done weekly, .  If the compounding is done daily, .  The most important thing to remember about using this formula is that it assumes that we put money in the account once and let it sit there earning interest.    The Future Value Spreadsheet Formula  The compound interest formula is built into spreadsheets and is called the future value formula.   Future Value Spreadsheet Formula   =FV(rate per period, number of periods, payment amount, present value)      rate per period  is the interest rate per compounding period,     number of periods  is the total number of periods,     payment amount  is the amount of regular payments. If none, enter     present value  is the amount deposited or principal,       We will use the payment amount in a future section, for now that will be 0. There is also an optional input at the end to specify making payments at the beginning or end of the period, but we will not use it in this book.  Now let's look at an example and calculate the compound interest using the spreadsheet and the mathematical formula.    A certificate of deposit (CD) is a savings instrument that many banks offer. It usually gives a higher interest rate, but you cannot access your investment for a specified length of time. Suppose you deposit $3000 in a CD paying 6% APR, compounded monthly. How much will you have in the account after 20 years?     , the initial deposit   , 6% annual rate   , 12 months in 1 year   , since we're looking for how much we'll have after 20 years  To use a spreadsheet, we will use the formula like this =FV(rate per period, number of periods, payment amount, present value)    =FV(0.06\/12, 12*20, 0, 3000)   and get a result of $9,930.61, rounded to the nearest cent.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    Note that the output of the formula gives the answer with the opposite sign as the principal and payments. A negative number may be denoted with a negative sign or with the color red or parentheses. The signs may be used in accounting, but we will ignore them in this book.  To use a formula, we are looking for the future value, so we use the formula solved for A:     To use a calculator, you would enter the formulas including parentheses around any inside operations. You would enter   3000(1+(0.06\/12))^(12*20)=$9930.61       Comparing Simple and Compound Interest  Let us compare the amount of money earned from compounding in the previous example against the amount you would earn from simple interest. From the table and graph below we can see that over a long period of time, compounding makes a large difference in the account balance. You may recognize this as the difference between linear growth and exponential growth.      Year  Simple Interest ($15 per month)  Compound Interest (6% compounded monthly or 0.5% each month    0  $3000  $3000    5  $3900  $4046.55    10  $4800  $5458.19    15  $5700  $7362.28    20  $6600  $9930.61    25  $7500  $13394.91    30  $8400  $18067.73    35  $9300  $24370.65     A coordinate graph with years on the x-axis and account balance on the y-axis. The simple interest increases in a straight line; the compound interest curves up faster because it is an exponential function.      Finding the Principal, or Present Value  When we know the amount of money we want to have in the future, we can use the formula that is solved for P . It requires a little algebra to divide both sides of the formula by the quantity that was multiplied by P . There is also a spreadsheet formula which we will introduce now, and then do an example using both methods.    The Present Value Spreadsheet Formula  The present value spreadsheet formula will calculate how much you need to deposit in the present to get a specified future value.   Present Value Spreadsheet Formula   =PV(rate per period, number of periods, payment amount, future value)      rate per period  is the interest rate per compounding period,     number of periods  is the total number of periods,     payment amount  is the amount of regular payments. If none, enter     future value  is the amount desired in the future,         You know that you will need $40,000 for your child's education in 18 years. If your account earns 4% APR compounded quarterly, how much would you need to deposit now to reach your goal?    We are looking for what we need to deposit now so we will use the present value formula. We type the formula and inputs the same way we used the future value formula.   =PV(rate per period, number of periods, payment amount, future value)    =PV(0.04\/4, 4*18, 0, 40000)   which gives a value of $19,539.84. You would need to deposit $19,539.84 now and keep the same interest rate to have $40,000 in 18 years.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    Note that we cannot enter commas in numbers in a spreadsheet. Commas are used to separate the input values, so we would not get the same answer if we put in $40,000 for an input.  To use the mathematical formula, we use the one that is solved for P .   , 4% APR   , 4 quarters in 1 year   , since we know the balance in 18 years   , the amount we have in 18 years  In this case, we're going to have to set up the equation, and solve for P.     You would need to deposit $19,539.84 now to have $40,000 in 18 years.      Continuously Compounded Interest  In many bank accounts your interest is compounded continuously, or at each moment in time. The number of times per year, n, is infinite. As n approaches infinity the compound interest formula changes to the continuously compounded interest formula.   Continuously Compounded Interest        A  is the future value or desired balance in the account    P  is the principal or present value    r  is the annual interest rate in decimal form    t  is the number of years    e  is an irrational number that is approximately 2.718281828… Find on your calculator to use this formula     To calculate this on a spreadsheet we use the =EXP function. The spreadsheet formulas are   =Principal*EXP(r*t) or =A\/EXP(r*t)      You deposit $4000 in an account that earns 2.75% APR compounded continuously. How much will you have after 7 years? How much interest did you earn? What percentage of the final balance is interest?      To use a spreadsheet, we look at the formula solved for A, the future value. We enter   =4000*EXP(0.0275*7)   and get a result of $4849.11.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    To use the formula, we have:      , amount invested   , interest rate   , number of years     After 7 years your account would be worth $4,849.11. Next, we will calculate the amount of interest earned and the percentage.      Finding the Amount of Interest Earned and the Percentage  In the previous example we also want to know how much interest was earned and what percentage of the final balance is from interest. The future value of the investment is $4,849.11. Now to figure out how much of that was interest, we need to subtract the amount initially deposited.   Continued: To find the total amount of interest earned, we subtract the principal from the total balance.     The spreadsheet calculation is   =4849.11-4000   which gives a result of $849.11. You would earn $849.11 in interest.  To find the percentage that is interest, divide the amount of interest by the total amount.     The spreadsheet calculation is the same:   =849.11\/4849.11   which is 0.1751 or 17.5%. This tells us that after 7 years, 17.5% of the account was earned as interest.     Effective Rate  If you are shopping around for different investments, you might need to compare different rates that have different compounding periods. If the rate and period are different, it's hard to know which account will give the better result. There is a spreadsheet formula called =EFFECT which will allow us to compare accounts. This is also sometimes called the annual percentage yield, or APY.   Effective Rate Formula   =EFFECT(stated rate, number of compounding periods)      stated rate  is the interest rate given (APR)    number of compounding periods  is the number of times the account is compounded per year,         You are comparing an account that pays 5.25% APR compounded monthly, with an account that pays 5% APR compounded daily. Which account will earn you more interest?    It is hard to tell whether the higher interest rate will be better or the higher compounding rate in this case. We will find the effective rate of both accounts.  For the 5.25% APR account compounded monthly:     =EFFECT(0.0525,12)   which gives 0.05378 or 5.38%    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    For the 5% APR account compounded daily:     =EFFECT(0.05,365)   which gives 0.05127 or 5.13%    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    Now we can compare the effective rates of 5.38% and 5.13% and see that the account with the higher interest rate will earn more interest in this case. This is not always true, so we will show another example.      Find the effective rates to compare an account that earns 6% APR compounded quarterly with an account that earns 5.975% APR compounded daily. Which one would you choose?    Using the effective rate formula for each, we have:  For the 6% APR account compounded quarterly:     =EFFECT(0.06,4)   which gives 0.06136 or 6.14%    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    For the 5.975% APR account compounded daily:     =EFFECT(0.05975,365)   which gives 0.06157 or 6.16%    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    The account that was compounded more often has a slightly higher rate in this case.      Exercises   A friend lends you $200 for a week, which you agree to repay with 5% one-time interest. How much will you have to repay?      You will have to repay $210.    You loan your friend $100. They agree to pay an annual interest rate of 3%, simple interest. Six months later they repay that loan.   How much did they pay you?    How much was interest?                    They paid $101.50 total, $1.50 was interest.    Consider a simple interest loan of $200 with an annual interest rate of 6%. If that loan is paid off 1 year and 3 months later, how much was repaid?      $215 was repaid.    You deposit $1,000 in an account that earns simple interest. The annual interest rate is 2.5%.     How much interest will you earn in 5 years?    How much will you have in the account in 5 years?                  The interest earned was $125. This brings the account balance to $1,125.    Consider an investment of $20000 with an annual interest rate of 5%.   If that investment is earning simple interest, how much will the investment be worth in 10 years?    If that investment is getting annually compounding interest, how much will the investment be worth in 10 years?                    The simple interest account would be worth $30,000 and the account that was compounding would be worth $32,577.89 in ten years.    Nico invests $4,500 into an account that has an annual interest rate of 8.5%. The interest is compounding monthly. Twenty years later what is the account balance?      The account balance is $24,485.59 in 20 years.  Or, =FV(0.085\/12,12*20,0,4500)     How much will $1,000 deposited in an account earning 7% APR compounded weekly be worth in 20 years?      The account balance is $4,051.38 in 20 years.  Or, =FV(0.07\/52,52*20,0,1000)     Suppose you obtain a $3,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) with a 3% APR, paid quarterly, with maturity in 5 years.     What is the future value of the CD in 5 years?    How much interest will you earn?    What percent of the balance is interest?            The future value is $3,483.55.  Or, =FV(0.03\/4,4*5,0,3000)        The interest earned is $483.54.       13.88% of the balance is interest.       You deposit $300 in an account earning 5% APR compounded annually. How much will you have in the account in 10 years?     How much will you have in the account in 10 years?    How much interest will you earn?    What percent of the balance is interest?            There will be $488.67 in the account in 10 years.  Or, =FV(0.05\/1,1*10,0,300)        $188.67 of the balance will be interest.       The interest makes up 38.61% of the balance.       You deposit $2,000 in an account earning 3% APR compounded monthly.     How much will you have in the account in 20 years?    How much interest will you earn?

The account will have $3,641.51 in 20 years  Or, =FV(0.03\/12,12*20,0,2000)        The interest will be $1641.51.       The interest is 45.08% of the balance.       The principal is 54.92% of the balance.       You deposit $10,000 in an account earning 4% APR compounded weekly.     How much will you have in the account in 25 years?    How much interest will you earn?    What percent of the balance is interest?    What percent of the balance is the principal?            The balance is $27,172.37.  Or, =FV(0.04\/52,52*25,0,10000)        The interest is $17,172.37.       The percent that is interest is 63.2%.       The percentage that is the principal is 36.2%.       How much would you need to deposit in an account now in order to have $6,000 in the account in 8 years? Assume the account earns 6% APR compounded monthly.      The principal required would be $3717.14  Or, =PV(0.06\/12,12*8,0,6000)     How much would you need to deposit in an account now in order to have $20,000 in the account in 4 years? Assume the account earns 5% APR compounded quarterly.

What will their balances be after 15 years?    What will their balances be after 30 years?    What is the effective rate for each account?            Or, =FV(0.046\/52,15*52,0,1200)      Or, =FV(0.0455\/52,15*52,0,1200)   Breylan has an account balance of $2,391.73 and Angad has a balance of $2,373.87       Or, =FV(0.046,52,30*52,0,1200)      Or, =FV(0.0455\/52,30*52,0,1200)   Breylan has an account balance of $4,766.97 and Angad has a balance of $4,696.06    Breylan =EFFECT(0.046,52) , which gives 4.71%  Angad =EFFECT(0.0455,52) , which gives 4.65%  Breylan has an effective rate of 4.71% and Angad has an effective rate of 4.65%.       Bill invests $6,700 in a savings account that compounds interest monthly at 3.75% APR. Ted invests $6,500 in a savings account that compound interest annually at 3.8% APR.     Find the effective rate for each account.    Who will have the higher accumulated balance after 5 years?         Bill =EFFECT(0.0375,12)  and Ted =EFFECT(0.038,1) =3.8%. Bill has an effective rate of 3.82% and Ted has a rate of 3.8%.       Or, =FV(0.0375\/12,5*12,0,6700)      Or, =FV(0.038,5,0,6500)   The account balances are $8,079.38 and $7,832.49. So, Bill's balance is higher.       Bassel is comparing two accounts where one pays 3.45% APR quarterly and the second pays 3.4% APR daily.     What is the effect rate for each?    If he has $5,000 to deposit how much will the balance be in 10 years?          =EFFECT(0.0345,4) = 3.49% and =EFFECT(0.034,365) = 3.46%. The effective rates are 3.49% and 3.46%.

A negative number may be denoted with a negative sign or with the color red or parentheses. The signs may be used in accounting, but we will ignore them in this book.  To use a formula, we are looking for the future value, so we use the formula solved for A:     To use a calculator, you would enter the formulas including parentheses around any inside operations. You would enter   3000(1+(0.06\/12))^(12*20)=$9930.61    "

  "body": " Credit Cards   Credit Cards    Apply for a credit card armed with basic knowledge.    Distinguish between three basic types of credit cards.    Compare and contrast the benefits and drawbacks of credit cards.    Read and understand the basic parts of a credit card statement.    Compute interest, balance due, and minimum payment due for a credit card.      It can be difficult to get along these days without at least one credit card. Most hotels and rental car agencies require that a credit card is used. There are even a number of retailers and restaurants that no longer accept cash. They make online purchasing easier. And nothing contributes more to a good credit rating than a solid history of making credit card payments on time.  Being granted a credits card is a privilege. Used unwisely that privilege can become a curse and the privilege may be withdrawn. In this section, we will talk about the different types of credit cards and their advantages and disadvantages. The more knowledge a cardholder has about the credit card industry, the better able credit accounts can be managed, and that knowledge may cause major adjustments to a cardholder's lifestyle.  All credit cards are not equal, but they all represent consumers borrowing money, usually from a bank, to pay for needs and “wants.” As such, they are a type of loan, and your repayment may include interest. (Loans and repayment plans are covered in .)  There are many institutions and credit cards to choose from. Use caution as you shop around for a credit card that suits you. Your top concern is likely the interest rates on purchases and cash advances. But be careful to also read the small print regarding charges for late payments, and other fees such as an annual fee, where the credit card charges you (the cardholder) a fee each year for the privilege of using the cards. Many cards charge no such fee, but there are many that charge modest to heavy fees. Make sure to understand rules for reward programs, where the credit card issuer grants benefits based on one's spending. Finally, once one applies for and is granted a credit card, pay attention to the credit limit the bank offers. Once a company is owed that much money, use of the card for purchases should be curtailed until some of the debt is paid off.    Types of Credit Cards  There are basically three types of credit cards: bank-issued credit cards, store-issued credit cards, and travel\/entertainment credit cards. We will look at all three and explain the good and the bad qualities of each.     Perhaps the most widely used credit card type is the bank-issued credit card , like Visa or MasterCard (and even American Express and Discover cards). These types of cards are an example of revolving credit, meaning that additional credit is extended before the previous balance is paid—but only up to the assigned credit limit. Bank-issued cards are considered the most convenient, as they can be used to purchase anything, including apparel, furniture, groceries, fuel for automobiles, meals, hotel bills, and so on, just as if paying with cash. The interest rates on bank-issued credit cards are usually lower than those for other credit cards we'll discuss, and the credit limits are generally higher. Currently, bank-issued cards have an average 20.09% APR.     Store-issued credit cards are issued by retailers. One can hardly walk into a store these days without being offered a discount on purchases if one applies for the store credit card. These cards can only be used in that store or family of stores that issues the card. However, if a store credit card is associated with Visa, MasterCard, or American Express, then the card might be used the same way that the bank-issued cards are used. This is called cobranding. The logo of the bank-issued card will be present on the store card. Many stores offer both types. Like other credit cards, they may come with an annual fee.  Store credit cards usually charge higher interest rates than bank-issued cards. Currently, store credit cards have an APR (annual percentage rate) of 24.15%. Any rewards offered by store credit cards are usually limited to purchases made in their own store, and it typically takes longer to accumulate enough rewards or points to redeem them, whereas cobranded credit cards offer opportunities to earn rewards on all purchases, regardless of whether purchases are made in the issuing store or not.  Store credit cards usually offer lower credit limits, at least in the beginning. After being proved to be a responsible credit card owner, credit limits can be raised. Nevertheless, store credit cards are a good choice for those new to the credit card industry.

The statements itemize and summarize activity on the credit card for that statement's billing period. The billing period for a credit card is generally a month long, but typically does not start and end on the first and last days of the month. The statement will include the current balance, interest rate, the minimum payment due, and the due date. Be aware, different companies produce statements that are laid out differently. The information will be clearly labeled though.  The due date is a top concern. Missing a due date is one of the worst things a cardholder can do financially, and this is by far the biggest downfall of owning a credit card.

Above all else, if you pay off the entire balance each month, interest is not charged.   How to Find the Average Daily Balance  Most credit card companies compute interest using the average daily balance method.  To find the average daily balance on your credit card, determine the balance on the card each day of the billing period (often that month), and take the average. One process to find that average daily balance follows these steps:   Start with a list of transactions with their dates and amounts.    For each day that had transactions, find the total of the transactions for the day. Expenditures are treated as positive values, payments are treated as negative values.    Create a table containing each day with a different balance. The balance is the previous balance plus the day's total transactions.    Add a column for the number of days those balances until the balance changed.    Add a column that contains the balances multiplied by the number of days until the balance changed.    Find the sum of that last column.    Divide the sum by the number of days in the billing period (often the number of days in the month). This is the average daily balance.      Computing Average Daily Balance   The billing cycle goes from May 1 to May 31. The balance at the start of the billing cycle is . The list of transactions on the card is below.      Date Activity Amount    1-May Balance $450.21    10-May Payment $120.00    15-May Groceries $83.43    26-May Auto Parts $45.12    26-May Restaurant $85.34    30-May Shoes $98.23     Find the average daily balance for the credit card during the month of May.

For moderate balances (between and ), the minimum would be a specified dollar amount. seems to be a common value.    If the balance is small (under for instance), then the minimum payment is the balance.    Those are just guidelines. Individual cards may vary in these values.     Minimum payments should only be paid if money is short in a given month. The length of time to pay off a credit card using minimum payments is quite long, and results in paying a lot of interest.

Prior to this, taxes were primarily collected through tariffs on imported goods, poll taxes, and property taxes. A poll tax , also referred to as a head tax, was a fixed amount every liable individual had to pay. Payment of the poll tax was often required before a person could register to vote or be issued a hunting or fishing license.  Tax policy in the United States is a politically divisive issue. In general, Democrats seek to lower taxes for low and middle income earners and raise taxes for the wealthy, while Republicans support a variety of tax cuts and limiting the amount wealthy earners are taxed. There is even debate as to the current length of the tax code! Some claim that the code is over 70,000 pages while others insist it is just over 2,000. Nevertheless, there is at least one thing everyone can agree with - you don't want to be on the wrong side of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)!    Types of Income Tax   Income tax is a tax that is levied on earned income or profit. Income taxes are collected by the federal government, states, and even some municipalities. Income taxes are an important source of funding, and are used to finance social programs, maintain and expand infrastructure, and provide foreign aid, among other things.    Federal Income Tax  Anyone who earns income over a certain amount (approximately $10,000 for an individual) must file a federal tax return and have taxes collected on their behalf. The amount of federal tax owed is determined by your filing status and taxable income .    State Income Tax  Forty-one states and the District of Columbia collect taxes on income from wages and investment. Seven states - Washington, Nevada, South Dakota, Wyoming, Alaska, Texas, and Florida – do not collect tax on wage or investment income, and two states – New Hampshire and Tennessee – only collect tax on investment income. The amount of tax collected varies by state, with each state averaging between $500 and $3000 per person.    Municipal Income Tax  Some municipalities (urban districts) also collect income taxes. For example, business owners in Multnomah County pay a municipal tax on their business income, and workers in the Tri-met district (area served by Tri-met) have their wages taxed at 0.7537%.    Calculating Federal Income Tax  Not all income is taxed, and not all income that gets taxed is taxed at the same rate. The general process of calculating the amount of federal income tax you owe is outlined in the chart below.   Steps to Calculate Federal Income Tax   Five rectangles showing the steps: 1. Calculate gross income by adding all income; 2. Calculate adjusted gross income (AGI) by subtracting any pre-tax adjustments; 3. Calculate taxable income by subtracting deductions (itemized or standard); 4. Calculate tax using tax table for your filing status; 5. Calculate refund or amount owed by subtracting credits and withholdings. If the amount is negative you get a refund; if the amount is positive you owe money.      Gross Income   Gross income includes all wages, tips, earned interest, dividends, rents and royalties, alimony, property gains, income tax refunds, etc. Keep in mind that ALL income means ALL income. Even income earned from a crime must be reported!    Adjusted Gross Income   Adjustments are eligible expenses used to reduce your gross income. Adjustments are tax-exempt and thus reduce the amount owed in taxes. Eligible expenses include contributions to tax deferred savings plans (401k, Individual Retirement Plan (IRA)), school tuition, student loan interest, moving expenses, business expenses, flexible spending accounts and health savings account contributions.    Taxable Income   Taxable income is determined by subtracting your deductions from your adjusted gross income. You may choose to take either a standard deduction , which is determined by your filing status, or you may choose to itemize your deductions. Itemized deductions may include state and local income taxes, property taxes, medical expenses, mortgage interest, and charitable donations.  Prior to the 2018 tax year, you could also claim personal exemptions . Exemptions of $4,050 for each member of the household were subtracted from the adjusted gross income along with either the standard or itemized deduction to determine taxable income. Starting in 2018, however, the standard deduction was doubled, and personal exemptions were eliminated.  Let's look at an example of how to calculate gross income and adjusted gross income (AGI).   Sasha received $45,000 in wages and earned $1,300 in interest from his savings plan. He paid $1,400 in student loan interest, and put $4,000 into his Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Determine Sasha's adjusted gross income.  To calculate Sasha's adjusted gross income, we need to first determine his gross income. His gross income includes his wages and earned interest:  Gross Income   To find his adjusted gross income, we need to subtract eligible adjustments from his gross income. His eligible adjustments include the interest paid on his student loans, and his contributions to his IRA:  Adjusted Gross Income      Filing Status  Your filing status is determined by your family situation. Are you married, widowed, divorced, caring for a family member? It is possible to fall into more than one category, but you may choose the one that is most beneficial for you.    Single: If you are unmarried, legally separated from your spouse, or divorced on the last day of the year.     Married Filing Jointly: If you are married and both you and your spouse agree to file a joint return. (On a joint return, you report your combined income and deduct your combined allowable expenses.)     Married Filing Separately: If you are married and you want to be responsible only for your own tax, or if this status results in less tax than a joint return.     Head of Household (with qualifying person): If you are 1) unmarried or considered unmarried on the last day of the year, 2) paid more than half the cost of keeping up a home for the year, and 3) have a qualifying dependent living with you for more than half the year (except temporary absences, such as school).     Qualifying Widow\/Widower (with dependent child): This status is available for the two years following the death of your spouse.     Your filing status determines your standard deduction and tax liability. The standard deduction for each filing status for the tax year 2024 is given in the table below.    Filing Status  Standard Deduction for Tax Year 2024    Single  $14600    Married Filing Jointly  $29200    Married Filing Separately  $14600    Head of Household  $21900    Qualifying Widow  $29200    Here is an example where we calculate adjusted gross income and taxable income.    Maria earned wages of $32,400 from her job as a server. She also earned $8,300 in tips, and received $95 in interest from a savings account. In trying to save for retirement, Maria has put $3,500 into a 401K tax deferred savings plan. She is unmarried and lives with her six year old daughter. Determine Maria's gross income, adjusted gross income, and taxable income.    Maria's gross income includes her wages, tips, and earned interest.  Gross Income = $32,400 + $8,300 + $95 = $40,795  Maria can use her 401k contribution as an adjustment.  Adjusted Gross Income = $40,795 - $3,500 = $37,295  Since Maria is unmarried and is the primary caregiver for her daughter, she can file as the head of household and take the standard deduction of $18,000.  Taxable Income = $37,295 - $18,000 = $19,295      Tax Tables  The United States has a progressive federal income tax system which means the more income you have, the more you generally pay in taxes. There are marginal tax rates that go up according to our income, but we don't pay the same rate on all of our income. The ranges of income are called tax brackets and the buckets in the illustration below can help us visualize the brackets.  The cutoff values in the figure are for a married couple filing jointly, but the percentages are the same for everyone as you'll see in the table on the next page. We pay 10% of any taxable income in the first bucket. If the first bucket is full, we move to the second bucket and we pay 12% of that income. This couple is in the 22% tax bracket because the 3rd bucket is partially filled. They will pay 22% of the income in that bucket, but they are not paying 22% of their entire income.   Tax Buckets by John Chesbrough, licensed under CC-BY-ND-NC 4.0 .   A drawing that shows the tax brackets as buckets being filled from a hose labeled taxable income; the first bucket for the 10% tax bracket is full and has the range of $0-19,050; the second bucket for the 12% tax bracket is also full and has the range of $19051-77,400; the third bucket for the 22% bracket is partially full and has the range of $77,401-165,000; there are buckets for the 24%, 32%, 35% and 37% tax brackets which are empty. The cutoff values for all of these brackets are given in the next table.    Here is a table with cutoff values for each filing status. Everyone pays a tax of 10% on any income in the first tax bracket. Then we all pay 12% of the next bracket of income, 22% of the next bracket, and so on. This keeps going up to the 37% tax bracket.   2024 Tax Year Marginal Tax Rates    Marginal Tax Rate On Taxable Income  Filing Single  Filing as Head of Household  Married filing Jointly  Married filing Separately    10%  First $11,600  First $16,550  First $23,200  First $11,600    12%  $11,600 – $47,150  $16,550 – $63,100  $23,200 – $94,300  $11,600 – $47,150    22%  $47,150 – $100,525  $63,100 – $100,500  $94,300 – $201,050  $47,150 – $100,525    24%  $100,525 – $191,950  $100,500 – $191,950  $201,050 – $383,900  $100,525 – $191,950    32%  $191,950 – $243,725  $191,950 – $243,700  $383,900 – $487,450  $191,950 – $243,725    35%  $243,725 – $609,350  $243,700 – $609,350  $487,450 – $731,200  $243,725 – $365,600    37%  Over $609,350  Over $609,350  Over $731,200  Over $365,600     Let's see how to use this table to calculate taxes in an example.    If Avery is filing single and has $55,100 in taxable income, calculate their tax.    We begin with the lowest tax bracket and take 10% of $11,600. Since their income is higher than that, we add 12% of the next amount, found by subtracting the values in that bracket. Avery's taxable income is in the 22% tax bracket, so we find the amount over $38,700 by subtracting. Here is the full calculation:      Avery would owe $7,175 in taxes. Note that their overall tax rate is somewhere between 10% and 22%. We can calculate the actual rate by dividing their tax owed by their taxable income:   or about 13%    We could calculate all taxes this way, but you might notice that the first few terms will be the same if the buckets are full. For this reason, we can simplify these tax tables. The tax tables below give the value for all of the lower tax buckets that are full. There is a tax table for each filing status and the cutoffs are regularly adjusted for inflation, so they usually vary from year to year.  The next four tables give the tax calculations for 2024 federal income taxes by filing status.

Calculate her taxes using the individual tax brackets and with the simplified table.    We will calculate Adira's taxes first the long way:        Now, using the simplified tax table for single filing status, we see that Adira's taxable income puts her in the 24% tax bracket. The simplified table tells us that her taxes will be equal to $15,469 plus 24% of the excess over $100,500. Notice the number $15,469 is very close to what we got for all of the “full” tax brackets, so we only need to calculate the last one. To find the excess over $82,500, we subtract $82,500 from her taxable income. Thus, her taxes are:     We see that both methods result in the same value, $16,897, for Adira's taxes.      Phyllis and Gladys are married and filing jointly. Together their taxable income is $132,000. Use the simplified 2024 tax tables from this section to determine how much they owe in taxes.    Since Phyllis and Gladys are married and filing jointly, their taxable income puts them in the 22% tax bracket. Using the simplified 2024 tax table, their taxes are $10,852 plus 22% of the excess over $94,300:     Phyllis and Gladys owe $19,146 in taxes.      Tax Credits   Tax credits are different from deductions in that they reduce the amount of tax you owe by the full amount of the credit, not just a percentage. This makes credits much more valuable than deductions.  Common tax credits include child tax credits, earned income credits, child and dependent care credits, American opportunity tax credits, lifetime learning credits, and various federal energy credits.    Shiro is in the 22% tax bracket and itemizes his deductions. How much will his tax bill be reduced if he makes a $1,000 contribution to charity? How much will his bill be reduced if he gets a $1,000 tax credit?    The tax credit will reduce his tax bill by the full amount of the credit, so the $1,000 tax credit will reduce his tax bill by $1,000. As a deduction, however, his contribution to charity will only reduce his tax bill by 22% of the $1,000, or 0.22($1,000) = $220. Tax credits are always better than deductions.      Calculating a Refund or Payment Due  Employers are required to take out an estimated amount for taxes from each of our paychecks. These withholdings are taken out, so we don't all have huge tax bills at the end of the year, and so the government has the income it needs to run. When you file your taxes, you compare the amount of tax you actually owe, with the withholdings from your paycheck. If you had more withheld during the year than you owe, you will file for a refund. If your withholdings were less, though, you must pay the difference. Let's look at a couple of examples with tax credits and withholdings.    John's taxes are $4,342.50. He can claim an American opportunity tax credit of $2,300 and he had $4,135 withheld from his paychecks. Determine if John will owe money or get a refund.    The first step is to reduce John's taxes by the full amount of the tax credit.     Next we subtract the amount withheld from his paychecks by his employer. Since his withholdings are greater than the amount he owes after applying the tax credit, he will receive a refund equal to the difference.     John will receive a refund of $1,092.50. Notice that having a negative amount after subtracting credits and withholdings means you will receive a refund, while having a positive amount means you still owe money.      As we discovered in , Phyllis and Gladys owe $19,146 in taxes. Their employers withheld $9,905 and they received a $8,500 credit for their purchase of an electric car. Will they receive a refund, or will they need to make a payment?    To determine whether they will receive a refund or if they will still owe money, we will first subtract the full amount of the electric car credit.     We now subtract their withholdings:     Since the value is positive, Phyllis and Gladys still owe $741 in taxes.      Exercises   Which decreases your tax bill more, a credit or a deduction?   A credit decreases your bill more. It decreases your bill by the full amount of the credit. A deduction only decreases your tax bill by a percentage.    You are in the 12% tax bracket and get a credit of $500. How has the amount of taxes owed changed?   The amount of taxes owed is decreased by $500.    You are in the 12% tax bracket and get a deduction of $500. How has the amount of taxes owed changed?   The amount of taxes owed is decreased by $60 because 12% of $500 is $60.    Can you take the standard deduction and itemize your deductions?   No, you must choose to take either the standard deduction or itemized deductions.    Can you make adjustments to your income and take the standard deduction?   Yes, you can make adjustments and take a deduction. Adjustments to your income happen before deductions.    If you decide to take the standard deduction what have you considered?   If you decide to take the standard deduction you determine that itemizing would not save you more money.    Shaysiah has paid $13,500 in mortgage interest which she can take as a deduction and has $1,900 in other deductions that she can take this year. She is filing as single. Should she itemize her deductions or take the standard deduction?   Shaysiah should itemize because itemizing reduces her taxable income by $15,400. The standard deduction would have reduced her taxable income by $14,600.    If you are married do you have to file your taxes together?   You can either file as married filing jointly or married filing separately.    Fredrick is concerned about the effect of a raise on his taxes. He's getting a raise of $3,000, putting him into a higher tax bracket by $1,000 dollars. He's concerned about his entire income being taxed at 22% instead of 12%. Should he be concerned? Why or why not?   No, Fredrick should not be concerned. Only the $1000 will be taxed at 22%. The rest of his income will be taxed at a lower level.    A single person with taxable income of $95,000 will have the first $11,600 of that income taxed at what rate? Determine the taxes owed on just the first $11,600.   The first $11,600 will be taxed at 10% resulting in $1,160 owed in taxes.    A single person with taxable income of $185,000 will have the first $11,600 of that income taxed at a different rate than the income between $11,600 and $47,150. Determine the taxes owed on just the second bracket.   There is a total of $35,550 between $11,600 and $47,150. 12% of $35,550 is $4,266.    Using the simplified 2024 tax table, determine the income tax owed for a single person who has $90,000 of taxable income.   $90,000 falls into the third tax bracket. The first two brackets resulted in $5,426 and the third bracket has the excess over $47,150 being taxed at the higher rate of 22%. This results in a tax of $13,539.50.       Doug and Chris are filing jointly. They owe $16,589 in taxes. Throughout the year they had $13,456 withheld from their paychecks, and they can claim an energy credit of $2,500 for purchasing a hybrid vehicle. Determine the amount they will need to pay or will get refunded.   $16,589 in taxes minus $13,456 for withholdings, and they can claim and $2,500 in credits. This leaves them owing $633.    Heather owes $7,589 in taxes. Throughout the year she had $6,456 withheld from her paychecks and she can claim an education credit of $1,980. Determine the amount she will need to pay or will get refunded.   $7,589 in taxes minus $6,456 for withholdings and education credit of $1,980. This leaves her refunded $847.    Determine the amount of taxes owed or the refund that would result in this situation:     Filing Status: Married filing jointly    Gross Income: $135,000    Adjustments: $5,600    Itemized Deductions: $19,400    Credits: $15,000     What is their adjusted gross income (AGI)?    Should they itemize or take the standard deduction?    Use the simplified 2018 tax tables to determine their taxes.    What is their final tax refund or amount still owed?            Take the income minus the adjustments . Their adjusted gross income is $129,400.    They should take the standard deduction because itemizing saves them less.    Taxable income:   Taxes owed:   They owe $12,150 in taxes.     Take the taxes owed minus credits and withholdings. They will receive a refund for $2,850.       Francis and Edward are planning to get married and they want to determine whether there is an advantage or disadvantage to marrying before the end of the year and filing their taxes jointly. Use the information below to calculate the amount they would owe or receive if they each filed as single, and the amount they would owe or receive if they filed jointly as a married couple. Which is the better choice?     Filing Status: TBD    Francis' Gross Income: $45,000    Edward's Gross Income: $50,000    Francis' Adjustments: $8,000    Edward's Adjustments: $4,000    Francis' Withholdings: $3,000    Edward's Withholdings: $3,500    Francis' Credits: $4,000    Edward's Credits: $1,000      SINGLE CASE:   Francis: Taxable Income     Tax from Table:     Owed\/Refund:       Edward: Taxable Income     Tax from Table:     Owed\/Refund:      Altogether, they will get a refund.

  "body": " Basics of Loans   Basics of Loans   Students will be able to:     Describe various reasons for loans.    Describe the terminology associated with loans.    Understand how credit scoring works.    Read an amortization table.      New car envy is real. Some people look at a new car and feel that they too should have a new car. The search begins. They find the model they want, in the color they want, with the features they want, and then they look at the price. That’s often the point where the new car fever breaks and the reality of borrowing money to purchase the car enters the picture. This borrowing takes the form of a loan.  In this section, we look at the basics of loans, including terminology, credit scores, payments, and the cost of borrowing money.    Reasons for Loans  Even if you want a new car because you need one, or if you need a new computer since your current one no longer runs as fast or smoothly as you would like, or you need a new chimney because the one on your house is crumbling, it’s likely you do not have that cost in cash. Those are very large purchases. How do you buy that if you don ’t have the cash? You borrow the money.  And for helping you with your purchase, the company or bank charges you interest.  Loans are taken out to pay for goods or services when a person does not have the cash to pay for the goods or services. We are most familiar with loans for the big purchases in our lives, such as cars, homes, and a college education. Loans are also taken out to pay for repairs, smaller purchases, and home goods like furniture and computers.  Loans can come from a bank, or from the company selling the goods or providing the service. The borrower agrees to pay back more than the amount borrowed. So there is a cost to borrowing that should be considered when deciding on a purchase bought with credit or a borrowed money. Even using a credit card is a form of a loan.  Essentially, a loan can be obtained for just about any purchase, large or small, that has a cost beyond a person’s cash on hand.    The Terminology of Loans   There are many words and acronyms that get used in relation to loans. A few are below.  APR is the annual percentage rate. It is the annual interest paid on the money that was borrowed. The principal is the total amount of the loan, or that has been financed. A fixed interest rate loan has an interest rate that does not change during the life of the loan. A variable interest rate loan has an interest rate that may change during the life of the loan. The term of the loan is how long the borrower has to pay the loan back. An installment loan is a loan with a fixed period, and the borrower pays a fixed amount per period until the loan is paid off. The periods are almost uniformly monthly. Loan amortization is the process used to calculate how much of each payment will be applied to principal and how much is applied to interest. Revolving credit , also known as open-end credit, is how most credit cards work but is also a kind of loan account. (We learn about credit cards in Credit Cards .) You can use up to some specified value, called the limit, any way you want, and as long as you pay the issuer of the credit according to their terms, you can keep borrowing from this account.    Credit Scores  Not everyone pays the same interest for the same loan. One person might get an APR of 2.9% while another pays 6.9%. These rates are based on your credit score.  Data about you and your credit is collected by three credit bureaus—Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. They calculate your score using one of two main models: FICO and Vantage Score. The score they develop is based on the following categories:      Payment History : Making your payments on time and not missing payments is by far the most important factor. All three credit types—revolving, installment, and open—contribute to this factor.     Credit Utilization or Amount Owed : How much do you owe on your credit card accounts? This category is concerned with the ratio of how much you owe on revolving credit accounts relative to your available credit, also known as your credit utilization ratio. This is the only category that depends solely on your revolving credit accounts.     Length of Credit History : This is the average age of your credit history, including the age of the oldest and newest accounts. All three types of credit accounts play a role in this category.     Credit Mix : This number represents the different types of credit accounts you have, such as credit cards, car loan, mortgages, and whether you are successful managing both revolving and installment accounts.     New Credit : Have you recently opened a new account or applied for new credit? Lenders want to know how much new credit you are taking on. So, if you are planning to buy a car and make another large purchase with a credit card, you may want to space these purchases out.     If you have done well in these categories, your credit score will be high, and you will qualify for lower interest rates because you are not perceived as being a risky investment. However, if you do poorly in these categories, your score will be low and you will pay higher interest rates since you present a greater risk.   Video: credit scores explained      Where Do Interest Rates Come From?  There are many factors that impact your interest rate beyond your credit score. Banks have the authority to set their own rates, so competition between banks impacts interest rates. Bank A doesn’t want to charge interest rates that are too high, since borrowers will find banks with better rates. Banks also don’t want to charge too little interest.  The too little interest is more involved than the too high. The bank needs to make a profit on its loans. Deposits at the bank are used by the bank to generate loans. The bank has to pay those depositors interest. The bank must charge more for loans they give than they pay to people with deposits in the bank.  Banks also borrow money from each other. These loans have an interest rate, and once more, the bank making a loan must make a profit. More directly, they must charge more for loans they give than they pay for loans they take. In the United States, banks may also borrow from the Federal Reserve, which also charges an interest rate, which is also called the discount rate.  This is where a bank’s prime rate comes from. A bank’s prime rate is the interest rate it will give to its very best customers, which means most customers will pay more than the bank’s prime rate. To confuse the issue, there is also the Wall Street Journal’s prime rate. It is the average of the prime rates charged by individual banks. The Wall Street Journal surveys several banks to generate this value.  Banks also increase the interest rate charged to customers based on both the credit risk presented by the customer, and the risk associated with what the loan will be used for.     Calculating Loan Payments  Loan payments are made up of two components. One component is the interest that accrued during the payment period. The other component is part of the principal. This should remind you of partial payments from Simple Interest .  Over the course of the loan, the amount of principal remaining to be paid decreases. The interest you pay in a month is based on the remaining principal, just as in the partial payments of Simple Interest .   Formula  The amount of interest, , to be paid for one period of a loan with remaining principal is , where is the interest rate in decimal form and is the number of payments in a year (most often ). Since the interest is for the one period, the time is 1 and does not impact the calculation. Note, interest paid to lenders is always rounded up to the next penny.    Interest for a Monthly Payment of a Loan   Find the interest to be paid for the period on loans with the following remaining principal and given annual interest rate. Each period is a month.     Remaining principal is $13,450, interest rate is 6.75%    Remaining principal is $8,460, interest rate is 5.99%          Substituting $13,450 for the remaining principal , 0.0675 for , and since the period is a month into the formula, we find that the interest to be paid this period is .    Substituting $8,460 for the remaining principal , 0.0599 for , and since the period is a month into the formula, we find that the interest to be paid this period is .

Remaining principal is $56,945, interest rate is 7.5%    Remaining principal is $25,850, interest rate is 2.9%         $355.91    $62.48        Reading Amortization Tables  An amortization table or amortization schedule is a table that provides the details of the periodic payments for a loan where the payments are applied to both the principal and the interest. The principal of the loan is paid down over the life of the loan. Typically, the payments each period are equal. Importantly, one of the columns will show how much of each payment is used for interest, another column shows how much is applied to the outstanding principal, and another column shows the remaining principal or balance ( Figure ).

  "body": " Personal Budget   Personal Budget   After completing this section, you should be able to:     Create a personal budget with the categories of expenses and income.    Apply general guidelines for a budget.      A budget is an outline of how money and resources should be spent. Companies have them, individuals have them, your college has one. But do you have one?  Creating a realistic budget is an important step in careful stewardship of your financial health. Designing your budget will help understand the financial priorities you have, and the constraints on your life choices. You want to have enough income to pay not only for the necessities, but also for things that represent your wants, like trips or dinner out. You also may want to save money for large purchases or retirement. You do not want to just get by, and you do not want the problems associated with overdue balances, rising debt, and possibly losing something you have worked hard to obtain.  While creating a budget may seem intimidating at first, coming up with your basic budget outline is the hardest part. Over time, you will adjust not only the numbers, but the categories.   Creating a Budget  You should view creating a budget as a financial tool that will help you achieve your long-term goals. A budget is an estimation of income and expenses over some period of time. You will be able to track your progress, which will help you to prepare for the future by making smart investment decisions.  There are several budget-creating tools available, such as the apps Good budget and Mint, and Google Sheets. Getting started, though, begins well before you find an app. The following are steps that can be used to create your monthly budget.    Track your income and expenses Review your income and expenses for the past 6 months to a year. This will give you an idea of your current habits.     Set your income baseline Determine all the sources of income you will have. This income may from paychecks, investments, or freelance work. It even includes child support and gifts. Be sure to use income after taxes. This allows you to determine your maximum expenditures per month.     Determine your expenses Review your bills from the past 6 months. You should include mortgage payments or rent, insurance, car payments, utilities, groceries, transportation expenses, personal care, entertainment, and savings. Using your credit card statements and bank statements will help you determine these amounts. Be aware that some of the expenses will not change over time. These are referred to as fixed expenses , like rent, car payments, insurance, internet service, and the like. Other expenses may vary widely from month to month and are appropriately called variable expenses , and include such expenses as gasoline, groceries.     Categorize your expenses These categories may be housing, transportation, or food, for broad categories, or may get more specific, where you categorize car payments, car insurance, and gasoline separately. The categories are your choices. Be sure to account for the cost of maintaining a vehicle or home. The more specific you are, the better you’ll understand your spending needs and habits.     Total your monthly income and monthly expenses and compare These values should be compared. If your expenses are higher than your income, then adjustments have to be made. Decisions of what to do with any extra income is part of the planning process also.     Make plans for unplanned expenses Ask anyone, an unexpected car repair can ruin a carefully crafted budget. Have a plan for how you can be ready for these random expenses. This often means creating a cushion in your budget.     Use your budget to make decisions and adjust for any changes Your budget is a changeable document. Add to it when you wish, refer to it when special purchases are to be made. Keeping your budget up to date helps accommodate changes in income and expenses.      Creating a BUdget    In this section, we will focus on income and expenses. One of the easiest ways to manage a budget is to create a table, with one column containing income sources, another with income values, a third with expense categories, and a last containing expenses. An example is shown in Table 6.1.   Gross Pay and Take Home Pay  If you’ve ever had a paycheck, you know that taxes are taken out of your pay before you get your check. This amount of money varies from state to state, and sometimes even city to city. For a person making $50,000 per year gross salary in Salt Lake City, Utah, take home pay is about 75.6% of gross salary. In Detroit, Michigan, take home pay is about 74.5% of gross salary. Lakeland, Florida, take home pay is about 80.5% of gross salary. These also change based on how much a person earns! Before choosing a place to live, it makes sense to determine how much deductions from pay will impact your income.     Heather has graduated college and currently works as a nurse for a rural medical group. Her net monthly income from that job is . She also works part-time on the weekends, earning another per month. Her monthly expenses are rent at car payments at , student loan payments at , car insurance at , utilities at , clothing at , entertainment (going out with friends, Netflix, Amazon Prime, movies) at , credit card debt at , food at , and gasoline at Create her budget in a table, compare the total income to total expenses, and determine how much excess income per month she has or how much she falls short by each month.     Step 1 : To begin, we create the table with appropriate headings.      Income Source Amount Expense Amount      Step 2 : Her income categories are her nursing job, with per month, and her part-time job, with per month. Entering these into the table, we have the following.      Income Source Amount Expense Amount    Nursing $3,765.40    Part-time $672.00      Step 3 : Her monthly expenses are listed above. Entering the categories and the amount for each of those expenses, the table is now      Income Source Amount Expense Amount    Nursing $3,765.40 Rent $1,050    Part-time $672.00 Car Payment $489    Total $4,437.40 Student Loan $728    Car Insurance $139    Utilities $130    Clothing $150    Entertainment $300    Credit Card $200    Food $400    Gasoline $250    Total $3,836      Step 4 : Totaling the income and expenses, we see that her total income is per month, and her total expenses are per month. Comparing these, we see that Heather has in excess income per month. This provides a cushion in her budget.     Mateo works as a union electrician in a suburban area. Monthly, his take home pay is He sometimes does small side jobs for family or friends, and averages about per month from these little jobs. His monthly expenses are his mortgage at truck payments at , truck insurance at , utilities at , clothing at , entertainment at , credit card debt at , food at , and gasoline at . Create Mateo’s budget in a table, compare the total income to total expenses, and determine how much excess income per month he has or how much he falls short by each month.      Creating a Budget   Carol is working in a dental lab, creating dentures and bridges. Monthly her take home pay is $2,816 (based on $22 per hour minus payroll taxes). She also receives $320 per month in child support for her one daughter. Her monthly expenses are rent at $700, car payments at $229, student loan payments at $250, car insurance at $119, health insurance at $225, utilities at $80, clothing at $75, entertainment at $200, food at $275, and gasoline at $275. Create Carol’s budget in a table, compare the total income to total expenses, and determine how much excess income per month she has or how much she falls short by each month.     Step 1 : To begin, we create the table with appropriate headings.      Income Source Amount Expense Amount      Step 2 : Her income categories are from work, $2,816, and child support, $320, per month. Entering these into the table, we have the following.      Income Source Amount Expense Amount    Job $2,816.00    Child support $320.00      Step 3 : Her monthly expenses are listed above. Entering the categories and the amount for each of those expenses, the table is now      Income Source Amount Expense Amount    Job $2,816.00 Rent $700    Child support $320.00 Car Payment $229    Total $3,136.00 Student Loan $250    Car Insurance $119    Utilities $80    Health insurance $225    Clothing $75    Entertainment $200    Food $275    Gasoline $275    Total $2,428.00        Maddy works as a mechanical engineer, making $6,093.75 monthly after payroll taxes. Her monthly expenses are her mortgage at $1,452.89, car payments at $627.38, car insurance at $179.00, health insurance at $265.00, utilities at $320, clothing at $150, entertainment at $400, credit card debt at $450, food at $370, and gasoline at $175. Create Maddy’s budget in a table, compare the total income to total expenses, and determine how much excess income per month she has or how much she falls short by each month.   Using the budget process, we can make decisions on adding expenses to the budget. To do so, check the cushion of the budget to see if there is room in the budget for the new expense.     Adding to an Existing Budget   In the example above, Carol had excess income of $708.00. She looks up the cost of before-school care for her daughter. She finds that, monthly, the cost would be $252.00 per month. Is this an affordable program for Carol? Add this expense to her budget table.    She can afford this, as the cost for the before school program is $252.00 and she had extra income of $708.00. Adding this to her budget, her budget table is now      Income Source Amount Expense Amount    Job $2,816.00 Rent $700    Child support $320.00 Car Payment $229    Total $3,136.00 Student Loan $250    Car Insurance $119    Utilities $80    Health insurance $225    Clothing $75    Entertainment $200    Food $275    Gasoline $275    Before-school care $252     Now, she has in excess income per month.     Recall Heather’s budget from . She decides she wants to buy her own home, which would increase her expenses. Instead of $1,050.00 in rent, she would pay $1,240.00 for her mortgage. Her utilities costs would increase to $295.00 per month. Add these to Heather’s budget to determine if the changes are affordable.     The 50-30-20 Budget Philosophy  It isn’t clear, obvious, or easy to decide how much of your income to allocate to various categories of expenses. Many people pay their bills and then consider all the leftover money to be spending money. However, when developing your own budget, you may want to follow the 50-30-20 budget philosophy , which provides a basic guideline for how your income could be allocated. Fifty percent of your budget is allotted to your needs, 30% of your budget is allotted to pay for your wants, and 20% of your budget is allotted for savings and debt service (paying off your debts).  Knowing what expenses are necessary and what expenses are wants is important, since wants and needs are often confused. The following are necessary expenses that represent basic living requirements and debt services. This list isn’t complete: mortgage\/rent, utilities, car, car insurance, health care, groceries, gasoline, child care (for working parents), and minimum debt payments. The 50-30-20 budget philosophy suggests that 50%, or half, your income go to these necessities.  Wants, though, are things you could live without but still wish to have, such as Amazon Prime, restaurant dinners, coffee from Starbucks, vacation trips, and hobby costs. Even a gym membership or that new laptop are wants. Creating the room to afford these wants is important to our mental health. Not budgeting for things we want will negatively impact our quality of life.  The remaining 20% should be set aside, either in retirement funds, stocks, other investments, an emergency fund (recommendations are that an emergency fund have 3 months of income), and perhaps extra spent to pay down debt. This 20% is very useful for addressing those unexpected costs, such as repairs or replacement of items that no longer work. Without budgeting this cushion, any expense that is a surprise can cause us to miss necessary payments.  The list of necessary expenses was not complete. There are other expenses that could be included.   Necessary Expenses and Expenses that are Wants  For some people, an expense will be necessary while the same expense for someone else will be a want. A good example of this is internet service. Many people consider internet service as a need, especially those who work from home or who are not able to leave their homes. One could also call internet service a need if they have children in school. For others, internet service is a want. If a person’s job doesn’t require them to be online, if they are not in school, if they do not have kids, then internet service can be dropped. There are public options for internet service. One could even use their phone as a hot spot.  Cars often fall into the category of need, but could also fall into the want category, depending on where and how you live. Bikes, public transportation, and walking are all options that could replace a car. This would then remove the cost of gasoline and car insurance.  Another consideration when deciding if an item on your budget is a need or a want is about your choices and priorities. A car is a need for many. But the need for a car is not the same as the need for a specific car. If you choose to buy a car with payments that exceed your budgeted amount for the car, then that car is a want. The amount you exceed the budget now belongs in the want category.  The same can be said for housing. If you want an apartment that costs $1,250 per month, but your budget only allows for an apartment that costs $900, then $350 of the rent is a want.  The point of that is to carefully consider if an expense is a need as opposed to a want.  When your expenses exceed your income, you may want to change how you budget your income to line up with these guidelines. This may mean cutting back, finding less-expensive living arrangements, finding a less-expensive (and more fuel-efficient) car, or sacrificing some specialty groceries. Using these guidelines keeps your financial life manageable.  Better still, they can guide you as you begin your life after graduation.     Evaluate a Budget Using 50-30-20 model   In the example above, after Carol added before school care for her daughter to the budget, her budget was as shown below. Evaluate Carol’s budget using the 50-30-20 budget philosophy.      Income Source Amount Expense Amount    Job $2,816.00 Rent $700    Child support $320.00 Car Payment $229    Total $3,136.00 Student Loan $250    Car Insurance $119    Utilities $80    Health insurance $225    Clothing $75    Entertainment $200    Food $275    Gasoline $275    Before-school care $252       Carol’s total income is Applying the 50-30-20 budget philosophy to this income requires the calculation of each of those percentages.  For the necessities, Carol should budget of her income, or   For her wants, she should budget of her income, or   For savings and extra debt service, she should budget of her income, or   In her budget, her necessities include all expenses except for entertainment. These expenses total , which exceeds the suggested budget amount of To follow the guidelines, Carol would have to cut back on these necessities.  For her wants, she spends on entertainment, which is well below the suggested budget amount of . If she modifies how much she spends on needs, she may be able to increase the spending on her wants.  Her excess income is which is below what she should be saving and using to pay down extra debt. If she does adjust how much she spends on needs, she could increase the amount for savings.     Recall Heather’s budget from Example 4.4.2, before she thought of moving. That budget is below. Evaluate Heather’s budget using the 50-30-20 budget philosophy.      Income Source Amount Expense Amount    Nursing $3,765.40 Rent $1,050    Part-time $672.00 Car Payment $489    Student Loan $728    Car Insurance $139    Utilities $130    Clothing $150    Entertainment $300    Credit Card $200    Food $400    Gasoline $250         Creating a Budget Based on the 50-30-20 Budget Philosophy   Carmen is about to graduate and has been offered a job at a bank as a data scientist. She estimates her monthly take home pay to be . Apply the 50-30-20 philosophy to that monthly income. How should Carmen use this information?     Step 1 : To apply the 50-30-20 budget philosophy to Carmen’s income, she needs to calculate , , and of her income. Fifty percent of her income is . Thirty percent of her income is . Twenty percent of her income is    Step 2 : She would then budget for her needs, for her wants, and for savings and debt service.   Step 3 : When choosing where to live, what to eat, and what to drive, she should make choices that keep those costs, combined with her debt service costs, gasoline, and utilities, below . This means she will have to make decisions about what her priorities are.   Step 4 : She should then figure out what she wants to do with her money, and stay within the limits, that is, keep those costs below .   Step 5 : Finally, she can begin building her savings with the remaining .     Elijah has finished an apprenticeship and is about to start his first job as an HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) tech. He estimates that his net monthly income will be . Apply the 50-30-20 budget philosophy to his income to set guidelines for Elijah’s budget. How should Elijah use this information?      Using the 50-30-20 Budget Philosophy to Analyze Affordability   Steve is thinking of moving out of his family’s home. He currently works at a full-time job making per hour, which will give him, approximately, a net annual income of (working 40 hours per week for 52 weeks per year). He has student debt that he pays off at per month, and already owns a car that he pays per month for.   Apply the 50-30-20 budget philosophy to Steve’s income.    If he follows the budget, how much does he have, after paying his car payment and student loan, to spend on necessities.    If he follows the budget, how much will he set aside for wants? For savings?    Discuss the affordability of moving out, based on Steve’s budget.       Before the 50-30-20 philosophy can be applied, Steve’s monthly income needs to be determined. This is found by dividing his annual income by 12. This gives . This will be used for his monthly budget.   To apply the 50-30-20 philosophy to Steve’s income, find , , and of his monthly income.   Needs : of his income is .    Wants :     Savings :        The total for Steve’s needs is . From this, he already pays for his student loans, and for his car payment. Together that is . Subtracting from the amount he should budget for his needs, he can spend on other needs.    Steve budgeted for wants, and for savings and other debt servicing.    Steve will have other needs to pay for, including rent, utilities, food, heath care, gasoline, and car insurance. It is difficult to imagine Steve being able to afford to move out, unless he reallocates money that he would want to save, or use for entertainment and other wants, or takes on another job. Even if Steve uses all the money that the 50-30-20 budget sets aside for savings, he still only has to spend on those necessities. It does not appear he can afford to move out.        Fran wants to take a new job but will have to move to an area with a higher cost of living. With her current income, she can use the 50-30-20 budget philosophy. The new job will have a net pay of annually. She will still have to pay her car payment of , her student loans that cost per month, and her outstanding credit card debt, on which she pays per month.   Apply the 50-30-20 budget philosophy to Fran’s new income.    If she follows the budget, how much does she have, after paying her credit card debt, car payment and student loan, to spend on necessities.    If she follows the budget, how much will she set aside for wants? For savings?    Discuss the affordability of changing jobs and moving, based on Fran’s budget.        "

  "body": " Savings Plans   Savings Plans   After completing this section, you should be able to:     Distinguish various basic forms of savings plans.    Compute return on investment for basic forms of savings plans.    Compute payment to reach a financial goal.      For most of us it is not practical to deposit a large sum of money in the bank. Instead, we save by depositing smaller amounts of money regularly. We might save in an IRA or 401-K for retirement. We might also save for a down payment on a car or house, or in a college savings plan for our children.  In this section, we will first look at the different types of savings accounts and proceed to discuss the various types of investments. There is some overlap, but we will try to differentiate among these financial instruments. Saving money should be a goal of every adult, but it can also be a difficult goal to attain.     Distinguish Various Basic Forms of Savings Plans  There are at least three types of savings accounts:   Traditional Savings Account    Certificate of Deposit    Money Market      Savings Account  A savings account is probably the most well-known type of investment, and for many people it is their first experience with a bank. A savings account is a deposit account, held at a bank or other financial institution, which bears some interest on the deposited money. Savings accounts are intended as a place to save money for emergencies or to achieve short-term goals. They typically pay a low interest rate, but there is virtually no risk involved, and they are insured by the FDIC for up to $250,000.  Savings accounts have some strengths. They are highly flexible. Generally, there are no limitations on the number of withdrawals allowed and no limit on how much you can deposit. It is not unusual, however, that a savings account will have a minimum balance in order for the bank to pay maintenance costs. If your account should dip below the minimum, there are usually fees attached.   Who Knew  Many banks are covered by FDIC insurance. The FDIC is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and is an independent agency created by the U.S. Congress. One of its purposes is to provide insurance for deposits in banks, including savings accounts. Be aware, not all banks are FDIC insured. The FDIC insures up to $250,000 for a savings account, so you do not want your balance to exceed that federally insured limit.   Having your savings account at the same bank as your checking account does offer a real advantage. For example, if your checking account is approaching its lower limit, you can transfer funds from your savings account and avoid any bank fees. Similarly, if you have an excess of funds in your checking account, you can transfer funds to your savings account and earn some interest. Checking accounts rarely pay interest.  There are some weaknesses to savings accounts. Primarily, it is because savings accounts earn very low interest rates. This means they are not the best way to grow your money. Experts, though, recommend keeping a savings account balance to cover 3 to 6 months of living expenses in case you should lose your job, have a sudden medical expense, or other emergency.  Around tax time, you will receive a 1099-INT form stating the amount of interest earned on your savings, which is the amount that must be reported when you file your tax return. A 1099 form is a tax form that reports earnings that do not come from your employer, including interest earned on savings accounts. These 1099 forms have the suffix INT to indicate that the income is interest income.  Savings accounts earn interest, and those earnings can be found using the interest formulas from previous sections. The final value of these accounts is sometimes called the future value of the account.     Savings Plan Formulas   This formula is used when we want to calculate the future value of a single payment or deposit. Here is the future value formula again:   The mathematical formula is shown below.   Savings Plan Formulas        A(t)  is the balance in the account after t years (future value)    r  is the annual interest rate in decimal form    n  is the number of compounding periods in one year    t  is the number of years        If the compounding is done annually (once a year), .  If the compounding is done quarterly, .  If the compounding is done monthly, ,  If the compounding is done weekly, ,  If the compounding is done daily,      Single Deposit in a Savings Account   Violet deposits $4,520.00 in a savings account bearing 1.45% interest compounded annually. If she does not add to or withdraw any of that money, how much will be in the account after 3 years?    To find the compound interest, use the formula from Compound Interest, where A represents the amount in the account after t years, with initial deposit (or principal) of P , at an annual interest rate, in decimal form of r , compounded n times per year. Violet has a principal of $4,520.00, which will earn an interest of 𝑟 = 0.0145, compounded yearly (so 𝑛 = 1), for 𝑡 = 3 years. Substituting and calculating, we find that Violet’s account will be worth               Violet will have $4,719.48 after 3 years.      Brian deposits $5,600 in a savings account that yields 1.23% interest compounded semi-annually. If he leaves that deposit in the account and adds nothing new to the account, what will the account be worth in 5 years?   $5,954.09    Who Knew  Banks have not always offered interest on savings accounts. An 1836 publication from Indiana noted that banks in other states allow small interest on deposits. It specifically says that in these other states, these deposits are what business transactions are based upon. And that giving interest would encourage deposits, and thus increase the business that banks can do.    Certificate of Deposits, or CDs  CDs differ from savings accounts in a few ways. First, the investment lasts for a fixed period of time, agreed to when the money is invested in the CD. These time periods often range from 6 months to 5 years. Money from the CD cannot be withdrawn (without penalty) until the investment period is up. Also, money cannot be added to an existing CD.  Certificates of deposit have features similar to savings accounts. They are insured by the FDIC. They are entirely safe. They do, though, offer a better interest rate. The trade-off is that once the money is invested in a CD, that money is unavailable until the investment period ends.      Certificate of Deposit   Silvio deposits $10,000 in a CD that yields 2.17% compounded semiannually for 5 years. How much is the CD worth after 5 years?    This also uses the compound interest formula from Compound Interest, Substituting the values P = $10,000, r = 0.0217, n = 2 (semiannually means twice per year), t = 5, we find the account will be worth,              The CD will be worth $11,239.53 after 5 years.     Denise deposits $3,500 in a CD bearing 2.23% interest compounded quarterly for 3 years. How much will Denise’s CD be worth after those 3 years?   $3,741.46    Money Market Account  A money market account is similar to a savings account, except the number of transactions (withdrawals and transfers) is generally limited to six each month. Money market accounts typically have a minimum balance that must be maintained. If the balance in the account drops below the minimum, there is likely to be a penalty. Money market accounts offer the flexibility of checks and ATM cards. Finally, the interest rate on a money market account is typically higher than the interest rate on a savings account.      Single Deposit to a Money Market Account   Marietta opens a money market account, and deposits $2,500.00 in the account. It bears 1.76% interest compounded monthly. If she makes no other transactions on the account, how much will be in the account after 4 years?    This also uses the compound interest formula from Compound Interest, Substituting the values P = $2,500, r = 0.0176, n = 12, t = 4, we find the account will be worth,              The money market account will be worth $2,682.20 after 4 years.     Chuck opens a money market account, and deposits $8,500.00 in the account. It bears 1.83% interest compounded quarterly. If he leaves makes no other transactions on the account, how much will be in the account after 3 years?   $8,978.57    Return on Investment  If we want to compare the profitability of different investments, like savings accounts versus other investment tools, we need a measure that evens the playing field. Such a measure is return on investment .    Formula  The return on investment, often denoted ROI, is the percent difference between the initial investment, P , and the final value of the investment, FV . expressed as a percentage.    Checkpoint  The length of time of the investment is not considered in ROI.      Determine the return on investment for the 5-year CD from . Round the percentage to two decimal places.    The initial deposit in the CD was $10,000, so P = $10,000. The value at the end of 5 years was $11,239.53. so FV = $11,239.53. Substituting and computing we find the return on investment.            The Return on Investment, ROI is 12.40%.       Calculating Return on Investment   Determine the return on investment for the money market account from . Round the percentage to two decimal places.    The initial deposit in the money market was $2,500, so P = $2,500. The value at the end of 4 years was $2,682.20. so FV = $2,682.20. Substituting and computing we find the return on investment.            The Return on Investment, ROI is 7.29%.     1. The amount of $13,000 is invested in a savings account. After 10 years the account has $15,250.00. Find the return on investment for this account.  2. The amount of $6,500 is deposited in a money market account. After 7 years, the account has $7,358.00. Find the return on investment for this account.   1. 17.31%  2. 13.2%    Return on Investment     Annuities as Savings  In Compound Interest , we talked about the future value of a single deposit. In reality, people often open accounts that allow them to add deposits, or payments, to the account at regular intervals. This agrees with the 50-30-20 budget philosophy, where some income is saved every month. When a deposit is made at the end of each compounding period, such a savings account is called an ordinary annuity.   Formula for the Future Value of an Ordinary Annuity  The formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity is:      FV  is the future value of the annuity.    pmt  is the payment.    r  is the annual interest rate (in decimal form)    n  is the number of compounding periods per year.    t  is the number of years.        Checkpoint  1. It is important to note that the number of deposits per year and the number of periods per year are the same.  2. Another form of annuity if the annuity due, which has deposits at the start of each compounding period. This other annuity type has different formulas and is not addressed in this text.      Future Value of an Ordinary Annuity   Jill has an account that bears 3.75% interest compounded monthly. She decides to deposit $250.00 each month, at the end of the compounding period, into this account. What is the future value of this account, after 8 years?    These are regular payments into an account bearing compound interest. She is depositing them at the end of each compounding period. This makes this an ordinary annuity. Substituting the values pmt = 250, r = 0.0375, n = 12, and t = 8 into the formula, we find the future value of the account.            The account, after 8 years will contain $27,938.20.     Kelly invests $525 every third month (quarterly payments), at the end of the compounding period, into an account bearing 3.89% interest compounded quarterly. How much will be in the account after 15 years?   $42,499.63    Setting Savings Account Interest Rates  There are a number of factors that contribute to the amount a bank gives for savings accounts. The interest rate reflects how much the bank values deposits. It also reflects the money that the bank will earn when they lend out money. Finally, interest rates are impacted by the Federal Reserve Bank. When the Fed raises interest rates, so do banks.    The Federal Reserve Chairperson  The Federal Reserve Board monitors the risks in the financial system to help ensure a healthy economy for individuals, companies, and communities. The Board oversees the 12 regional reserve banks. The Chairperson of the Federal Reserve Board testifies to Congress twice per year, meets with the secretary of the Treasury, chairs the Federal Open Market Committee, and is the face of federal monetary policy. Currently, the Fed Chair is Jerome Powell, who has served since 2018.      Future Value of an Ordinary Annuity: Saving for College   When Yusef was born, Rita and George began to save for Yusef’s college years by investing $2,500 each year in a savings account bearing 3.4% interest compounded annually. How much will they have saved after 18 years?    To find the future value of the account, we use the ordinary annuity formula; The payment pmt = $2,500, the interest rate r = 0.034 (as a decimal) the number of compunding periods n = 1, the number of years, t = 18. We find the future value of the account by substituting these values and computing,            After saving for 18 years, Rita and George will have $60,694.77 for Yusef’s college.     Bemnet saves $280 per month in a savings account bearing 3.11% interest compounded monthly. After 20 years, how much does Bemnet have in the account?   $93,037.59     Compute Payment to Reach a Financial Goal  The formula used to get the future value of an ordinary annuity is useful, finding out what the final amount in the account will be. However, that isn’t how planning works. To plan, we need to know how much to put into the ordinary annuity each compounding period in order to reach a goal. Fortunately, that formula exists.   Formula for the Amount that Needs to be Deposited per period pmt , of an ordinary annuity  The formula for the amount that needs to be deposited per period, pmt , of an ordinary annuity to reach a specified goal, FV is:      pmt  is the payment to be calculated for.    FV  is the future value of the annuity.    r  is the annual interest rate (in decimal form)    n  is the number of compounding periods per year.    t  is the number of years.  With this formula, it is possible to plan the amount to be saved         Saving For a Car   Yaroslava wants to save in order to buy a car, in 3 years, without taking out a loan. She determines that she willl need $35,500 for the purchase. If she deposits money into an ordinary annuity that yields 4.25% interest compounded monthly, how much will she need to deposit each month?    Yaroslava has a goal and needs to know the payments to make to reach the goal. Her goal is FV = $35,500, with an interest rate r = 0.0425, compounded per month so n = 12, and for 3 years, making t = 3. Substituting into the formula, Yaroslava finds the necessary payment.             To reach her goal, Yaroslava would need to deposit $926.33 in her account each month.     This has been rounded up, so that the deposits don’t fall short of the goal. However, some round off using the standard rounding rules: if the last digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4, the number is rounded down; if the last digit is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 the number is rounded up.    Chione decides to put new siding on her house. She finds that it will cost about $27,800. She decides to begin saving for the purchase so that she doesn’t take on debt to side the house. How much would Chione need to deposit every 6 months in an ordinary annuity that yields 5.16% compounded semi-annually for 5 years?   $2,250.60            You set up a savings plan for retirement in 35 years.

Understand what bonds are and how bond investments work.    Understand how stocks are purchased and gain or lose value.    Define a mutual fund and how to invest.    Compute payment to reach a financial goal.    Identify and distinguish between retirement savings accounts.      You can save your money in a safe or a vault (or worse, under the mattress!), but that money does not grow. It would be hard to save enough for retirement that way. What can be done to increase the value of the money you already have?  The answer is to invest it. Use the money that you have to earn more money back. For instance, as we saw in Savings Plans , you can save it in a bank. Or, to reach loftier goals, invest in something more likely to grow, such as stocks.  A great example of this is Apple stock. Anyone who bought stock in Apple Inc. (formerly Apple Computer, Inc.) in 1997 and held onto the shares earned a lot of money. To be more specific, $100 worth of Apple shares bought in 1980, when it was first sold to the public, was valued at $67,564 in 2019, or 676 times more! Perhaps you have heard a story like that, of an investment opportunity taken that paid off, or the story of an investment opportunity missed. But such stories are the exceptions.  In this section, we’ll investigate bonds, stocks, and mutual funds and their comparative strengths and weaknesses. We close the section with a discussion of retirement savings accounts.    Distinguish Between Basic Forms of Investments   Bonds, stocks, and mutual funds tend to offer higher returns, but to varying degrees, come with higher risks. Stocks and mutual funds also vary in how much they earn. Their predicted rates of return on investment are not guaranteed, but educated guesses based on market trends and historical performance.  We will use the methods and formulas we learned earlier to evaluate these forms of investment.    Bonds   Bonds are issued from big companies and from governments. Selling bonds is an alternative to an institution taking a loan from a bank. The funds from the selling of bonds are often used for large projects, like funding the building of a new highway or hospital.  Bonds are considered a conservative investment. They are bought for what is known as the issue price . The interest is fixed (does not change) at the time of purchase and is based on the issue price of the bond. The interest rate is often referred to as the coupon rate; the interest paid is often called the coupon yield. The interest paid is often higher than savings accounts and the risk is exceptionally low. The bond is for a fixed length of time. The end of this time is the maturity date of the bond.  There are several types of bonds:    Treasury bonds are issued by the federal government.     Municipal bonds are issued by state and local governments.     Corporate bonds are issued by major corporations.     There are other types of bonds available, but they are beyond the scope of this section.   Trading Bonds  Bonds are often part of larger investment portfolios. These bonds may be traded. However, the interest paid is based on the price when the bond was bought (the issue price). These bonds can be bought and sold for more or less money than the issue price. If the bond is bought for more than the issue price, the interest is still paid on the issue price, not on the purchase price when the trade was made. This means the actual return on the bond decreases. If the bond is bought for less than the issue price, the return on the bond goes up.    Video on bonds    Bond Investment   Muriel purchases a $3,000 bond with a maturity of 4 years at a fixed coupon rate of 5.5% paid annually. How much is Muriel paid each year, and how much does she receive on the maturity date?    The coupon rate is 5.5%. 5.5% of her bond value is 0.055 $3,000=$165. After year 1, Muriel receives $165. She receives $165 after years 2 and 3 also. In year 4, when the bond matures, Muriel receives $3,165, or the interest and the initial investment, or principal.     Maureen invests $5,000 in a bond with a maturity date in 5 years at a fixed coupon rate of 4.75%. How much is Maureen paid each year and how much does she receive on the maturity date?   $237.50 per year, $5,237.50 on maturity date.      Stocks    Stocks are part ownership in a company. They come in units called shares . The performance and earnings of stocks is not guaranteed, which makes them riskier than any other investment discussed earlier. However, they can offer higher return on investment than the other investments. Their value grows in two ways. They offer dividends , which is a portion of the profit made by the company. And the price per share can increase based on how others see that value of the company changing. If the value of the company drops, or the company folds, the money invested in the stock also drops.  Most stock transactions are executed through a broker. Brokers' commissions can be a percentage of value of the trades made or a flat fee. There are full-service brokers who charge higher commission rates, but they also offer financial advice and perform the research that you may not have the time or the expertise to do on your own. A discount broker only executes the stock transactions, buying or selling, so they charge lower rates than full-service brokers. There are also brokers that offer commission-free trading.  An important thing to remember is that stocks might provide a very large return on investment, but the trade-off is the risk associated with owning stocks.     Buying Stock in Company ABC   Haniah buys stock in the ABC company, investing a total of $13,000. She expects the stock to grow, through stock price increase and reinvestment of dividends, by 12.3% per year and compounded annually. If she leaves that money invested, how much will the stocks be worth in 20 years?    Calculating this is a compound interest calculation, if Haniah’s assumption about the stock’s performance is correct. If so, then the principal is $13,000, the rate is 0.123, the number of compounding periods per year is 1, and the time is 20 years. Substituting into the compound interest formula and computing, we have   After 20 years, her stock is now worth $132,293.49.     Rixie deposits $23,000 in the stock of DEF company. She assumes the stock value to grow though stock price increase and reinvestment of dividends by 13.8% compounded annually. How much will her stock be worth in 12 years?   $108,501.30    Risk and Volkswagen  The question of risk hovers over every investment. How risky can it get? Volkswagen seems to be a rather safe investment. But in 2015, Volkswagen's stock tumbled 30% over a few days when it was revealed that the company had installed software that altered the emission performance of some of their diesel engines. Volkswagen's hope was that lower emissions would bolster US sales of some of their diesel models. This was a drastic drop, and many investors lost a lot of money. However, the stock has come back since then. This was mild compared to the 65% drop in the Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia stocks.     Mutual Funds  A mutual fund is a collection of investments that are all bundled together. When you buy shares of a mutual fund, your money is pooled with the assets of other investors. This pooled money is invested in stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and other assets. Mutual funds are typically operated by professional money managers who allocate the fund's assets and attempt to produce capital gains or income for the fund's investors.  A key benefit of mutual funds is that they allow small or individual investors to invest in professionally managed portfolios of equities, bonds, and other securities. This means each shareholder participates proportionally in the gains or losses of the fund. The performance of a mutual fund is usually stated as how much the mutual fund's total value has increased or decreased. Since there are many different investments inside the mutual fund, the risk is reduced significantly, compared to direct ownership of stocks. Even so, mutual funds historically perform well and can earn more than 10% annually.  The investments that make up a mutual fund are structured and maintained to match stated investment objectives, which are specified in its prospectus . A prospectus is a pamphlet or brochure that provides information about the mutual fund. Before buying shares of a mutual fund, consult its prospectus, consider its goals and strategies to see if they match your goals and values and also research any associated fees.   Video on mutual funds    Investing in a Mutual Fund   Kaitlyn has analyzed her $12,862.50 quarterly budget using the 50-30-20 budget philosophy, and sees she should be saving or paying down debt with $2,572.50 per quarter. She decides to invest $1,300 quarterly a mutual fund that reports an average return of 11.62% over the 18-year life of the mutual fund. Assuming that this interest rate continues, and is compounded quarterly, how much will her mutual fund account be worth after 5 years?    Kaitlyn's plan is an ordinary annuity, and so the future value of her account can be found using the formula , with a payment of $1,300, a rate of 0.1162, number of compounding periods 4, after 5 years. Substituting these values into the formula and calculating, we find   Kaitlyn's mutual fund will be worth $34,595.88 after 5 years.     Aidan decides to invest $3,200 annually in a mutual fund. He expects the fund to have a 10.8% interest rate compounded annually. How much will Aidan's mutual fund account have after 15 years?   $108,352.43   Investing in a Mutual Fund to Reach a Goal   Kaitlyn wants to retire with $1,500,000 in her mutual fund account. She will invest for 35 years. The mutual fund reports an average return of 11.62% over the 18-year-long life of the mutual fund. Assuming that this interest rate continues, and is compounded quarterly, how much will she need to pay annually into her mutual fund to reach her goal?    Kaitlyn’s plan is an ordinary annuity, and so the payment to reach her goal can be found using the formula with a , or goal, of $1,500,000, a rate of 0.1162, for 35 years. Substituting these values into the formula and calculating, we find   Kaitlyn needs to invest $6,689.49 per year (or $557.46 per month) into the mutual fund to reach $1,500,000 in 35 years.     How much does Aidan need to invest annually in his mutual fund to reach a goal of $1,000,000 in 40 years? He expects the fund to have a 10.8% interest rate compounded annually.   $1,815.83      Retirement Savings Plans   We close this section by investigating the three main forms of retirement savings accounts: traditional individual retirement accounts (IRAs), Roth IRAs, and 401(k) accounts. Each has distinct characteristics that are suited to different investors' needs.    Individual Retirement Accounts  A traditional IRA lets you contribute up to an amount set by the government, which may change from year to year. For example, the maximum contribution for 2022 is $6,000; $7,000 over age 50. Anyone is eligible to contribute to a traditional IRA, regardless of your income level. Your money grows tax-deferred, but withdrawals after age 59½ are taxed at current rates. Traditional IRAs also allow you to use the contribution itself as a deduction on a current year tax return.   Roth IRAs allow contributions at the same levels as traditional IRAs, with a maximum $6,000 for 2022; $7,000 over age 50. However, to be eligible to make contributions, your earned income must be below a certain level. A Roth IRA allows after-tax contributions. In other words, the contribution itself is not tax-deductible, as it is with the traditional IRA. However, your money grows tax-free. If you make no withdrawals until you are age 59½, there are no penalties. IRAs pay a modest interest rate.  In either case, IRA deposits have to be from earned income, which in effect means if your earned income is over $6,000 ($7,000) then you can deposit the maximum.   In 2022, the maximum that can be added to a Roth IRA was $6,000 for those under 50 years of age. For those over 50 years of age, the maximum that can be added to a Roth IRA is $7,000. However, to qualify for a Roth IRA in fall of 2022, a single person’s modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) must be below $129,000. Then, if a single person’s income is between $129,000 and $144,000, the maximum contribution is reduced from the limit for incomes below $129,000. For a married couples filing a joint tax return those values are $204,000 to $214,000.     401(k) Accounts  Your employer may offer a retirement account to you. These are often in the form of a 401(k) account. There are traditional and Roth 401(k) accounts, which differ in how they are taxed, much as with other IRAs. In the traditional 401(k) plans, the money is deposited before tax is assessed, which means you do not pay taxes on this money. However, that means when money is withdrawn, it is taxed. These accounts are similar to mutual funds, in that the money is invested in a wide range of assets, spreading the risk.  One of the perks some employers offer is to match some amount of your contributions to the 401(k) plan. For instance, they may match your deposits up to 5% of your income. This is an instant 100% return on the money that was matched.   Video on 410(k) accounts     Matching 401(k) Deposit   Alice signs up for her employer-based 401(k). The employer matches any 401(k) contribution up to 6% of the employee salary. Alice’s annual salary is $51,600.   What is the most money that Alice can deposit that will be fully matched by the company?    How much total will be deposited into Alice’s account if she deposits the full 6%?    How much return does Alice earn if she deposits exactly 6% in her 401(k)?          The employer will match up to 6% of any employee’s salary. 6% of Alice’s salary is 0.06 $51,600=$3,096. So Alice can deposit up to $3,096 and receive that amount in matching funds in her account.    Alice’s contribution plus the company’s contribution is $3,096+$3,096=$6,192, which is the total that is deposited into Alice’s account.    She earns a 100% return on the day she deposits her $3,096.        Jameis signs up for his employer-based 401(k). The employer matches any 401(k) contribution up to 7.5% of the employee salary. Jameis’ annual salary is $72,800.    What is the most money that Jameis can deposit that will be fully matched by the company?    How much total will be deposited into Jameis’ account if he deposits the full 7.5%?    How much return does Jameis earn if he deposits exactly 7.5% in his 401(k)?        $5,460    $10,920    100% return on the $5,460 deposit         "

Volkswagen's hope was that lower emissions would bolster US sales of some of their diesel models. This was a drastic drop, and many investors lost a lot of money. However, the stock has come back since then. This was mild compared to the 65% drop in the Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia stocks.  "
