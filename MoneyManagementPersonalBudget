Learning Objectives
After completing this section, you should be able to:

1. Create a personal budget with the categories of expenses and income.
2. Apply general guidelines for a budget.

A budget is an outline of how money and resources should be spent. Companies have them, individuals have them, your college has one. But do you have one?

Creating a realistic budget is an important step in careful stewardship of your financial health. Designing your budget will help understand the financial priorities you have, and the constraints on your life choices. You want to have enough income to pay not only for the necessities, but also for things that represent your wants, like trips or dinner out. You also may want to save money for large purchases or retirement. You do not want to just get by, and you do not want the problems associated with overdue balances, rising debt, and possibly losing something you have worked hard to obtain.

While creating a budget may seem intimidating at first, coming up with your basic budget outline is the hardest part. Over time, you will adjust not only the numbers, but the categories.

Creating a Budget
You should view creating a budget as a financial tool that will help you achieve your long-term goals. A budget is an estimation of income and expenses over some period of time. You will be able to track your progress, which will help you to prepare for the future by making smart investment decisions.

There are several budget-creating tools available, such as the apps Good budget and Mint, and Google Sheets. Getting started, though, begins well before you find an app. The following are steps that can be used to create your monthly budget.

1. Track your income and expenses Review your income and expenses for the past 6 months to a year. This will give you an idea of your current habits.
2. Set your income baseline Determine all the sources of income you will have. This income may from paychecks, investments, or freelance work. It even includes child support and gifts. Be sure to use income after taxes. This allows you to determine your maximum expenditures per month.
NOTE: For income that is not steady, such as gig work or freelance work, use the previous 6 to 12 months of income to find an average income from that gig or freelance work. Use this average in the budgeting process.
3. Determine your expenses Review your bills from the past 6 months. You should include mortgage payments or rent, insurance, car payments, utilities, groceries, transportation expenses, personal care, entertainment, and savings. Using your credit card statements and bank statements will help you determine these amounts. Be aware that some of the expenses will not change over time. These are referred to as fixed expenses, like rent, car payments, insurance, internet service, and the like. Other expenses may vary widely from month to month and are appropriately called variable expenses, and include such expenses as gasoline, groceries.
NOTE: Some expenses are yearly, such as insurance or property taxes. Other expanses may be quarterly (four times per year) or semiannual (twice per year). To budget for such bills by month, divide the bill total by the number of months the bill covers.
4. Categorize your expenses These categories may be housing, transportation, or food, for broad categories, or may get more specific, where you categorize car payments, car insurance, and gasoline separately. The categories are your choices. Be sure to account for the cost of maintaining a vehicle or home. The more specific you are, the better youâ€™ll understand your spending needs and habits.
5. Total your monthly income and monthly expenses and compare These values should be compared. If your expenses are higher than your income, then adjustments have to be made. Decisions of what to do with any extra income is part of the planning process also.
6. Make plans for unplanned expenses Ask anyone, an unexpected car repair can ruin a carefully crafted budget. Have a plan for how you can be ready for these random expenses. This often means creating a cushion in your budget.
7. Use your budget to make decisions and adjust for any changes Your budget is a changeable document. Add to it when you wish, refer to it when special purchases are to be made. Keeping your budget up to date helps accommodate changes in income and expenses.
