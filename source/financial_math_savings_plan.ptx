<introduction>
	<p>
		For most of us it is not practical to deposit a large sum of money in the bank. Instead, we save by depositing smaller amounts of money regularly. We might save in an IRA or 401-K for retirement. We might also save for a down payment on a car or house, or in a college savings plan for our children.
	</p>
	<p>
		In this section, we will first look at the different types of savings accounts and proceed to discuss the various types of investments. There is some overlap, but we will try to differentiate among these financial instruments. Saving money should be a goal of every adult, but it can also be a difficult goal to attain.

		<li>
			<p>
				Traditional Savings Account
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>

   <subsubsection>
		<title>Savings Account</title>
		<p>
			A savings account is probably the most well-known type of investment, and for many people it is their first experience with a bank. A <term>savings account</term> is a deposit account, held at a bank or other financial institution, which bears some interest on the deposited money. Savings accounts are intended as a place to save money for emergencies or to achieve short-term goals. They typically pay a low interest rate, but there is virtually no risk involved, and they are insured by the FDIC for up to $250,000.

        </p> 
		<p> 
		 Savings accounts have some strengths. They are highly flexible. Generally, there are no limitations on the number of withdrawals allowed and no limit on how much you can deposit. It is not unusual, however, that a savings account will have a minimum balance in order for the bank to pay maintenance costs. If your account should dip below the minimum, there are usually fees attached.
		</p>
		<assemblage>
			<title>Who Knew</title>
			<p>
				Many banks are covered by FDIC insurance. The FDIC is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and is an independent agency created by the U.S. Congress. One of its purposes is to provide insurance for deposits in banks, including savings accounts. Be aware, not all banks are FDIC insured. The FDIC insures up to $250,000 for a savings account, so you do not want your balance to exceed that federally insured limit.
			</p>
		</assemblage>
		<p>
			Having your savings account at the same bank as your checking account does offer a real advantage. For example, if your checking account is approaching its lower limit, you can transfer funds from your savings account and avoid any bank fees. Similarly, if you have an excess of funds in your checking account, you can transfer funds to your savings account and earn some interest. Checking accounts rarely pay interest.

		</p>
		<p>
			There are some weaknesses to savings accounts. Primarily, it is because savings accounts earn very low interest rates. This means they are not the best way to grow your money. Experts, though, recommend keeping a savings account balance to cover 3 to 6 months of living expenses in case you should lose your job, have a sudden medical expense, or other emergency.

		</p>
		<p>
			Around tax time, you will receive a 1099-INT form stating the amount of interest earned on your savings, which is the amount that must be reported when you file your tax return. A <term>1099 form</term> is a tax form that reports earnings that do not come from your employer, including interest earned on savings accounts. These 1099 forms have the suffix INT to indicate that the income is interest income.

		</p>
		<p>
			Savings accounts earn interest, and those earnings can be found using the interest formulas from previous sections. The final value of these accounts is sometimes called the future value of the account.

	<title>Savings Plan Formulas</title>
	<!-- <p>
		To make calculations for savings plans using a spreadsheet, we can use the <c>=FV</c> formula we have already used. This time for regular payments we will use the field for payment amount. If we are not making an initial deposit, the present value will be zero.

		<title>Who Knew</title>
		<p>
			Banks have not always offered interest on savings accounts. An 1836 publication from Indiana noted that banks in other states allow small interest on deposits. It specifically says that in these other states, these deposits are what business transactions are based upon. And that giving interest would encourage deposits, and thus increase the business that banks can do.

	<subsection>
		<title>Certificate of Deposits, or CDs</title>
		<p>
			CDs differ from savings accounts in a few ways. First, the investment lasts for a fixed period of time, agreed to when the money is invested in the CD. These time periods often range from 6 months to 5 years. Money from the CD cannot be withdrawn (without penalty) until the investment period is up. Also, money cannot be added to an existing CD.
		</p>
		<p>
			Certificates of deposit have features similar to savings accounts. They are insured by the FDIC. They are entirely safe. They do, though, offer a better interest rate. The trade-off is that once the money is invested in a CD, that money is unavailable until the investment period ends.

	<title>Money Market Account</title>
	<p>
		A <term>money market account</term> is similar to a savings account, except the number of transactions (withdrawals and transfers) is generally limited to six each month. Money market accounts typically have a minimum balance that must be maintained. If the balance in the account drops below the minimum, there is likely to be a penalty. Money market accounts offer the flexibility of checks and ATM cards. 
		Finally, the interest rate on a money market account is typically higher than the interest rate on a savings account.

	<title>Annuities as Savings</title>
<p>
	In <term>Compound Interest</term>, we talked about the future value of a single deposit. In reality, people often open accounts that allow them to add deposits, or payments, to the account at regular intervals. This agrees with the 50-30-20 budget philosophy, 
	where some income is saved every month. When a deposit is made at the end of each compounding period, such a savings account is called an ordinary annuity.

		</p>
		<p>
			<m>n=12</m>, since we're depositing monthly

		Now let's compare two scenarios to do some multistep problems and get a sense for the value of compounding over time.

		<statement>
		<p>
			Scenario 1: Suppose you invest $200 a month for 15 years into an account earning 10% APR compounded monthly. After 15 years, you leave the money, without making additional deposits, in the account for another 20 years. How much will you have in the end?
		</p>
		<p>
			Scenario 2: Suppose instead you didn't invest anything for the first 15 years, then deposited $200 a month for 20 years into an account earning 10% APR compounded monthly. How much will you have in the end?
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
		<p>
			Before we calculate the balance for both scenarios, which one do you think will have a higher balance at the end?
		</p>
		<p>
			For scenario 1, there are two steps involved. The first part is the monthly payments for 15 years. To calculate this with a spreadsheet we enter

		</p>
		
		<sidebyside valign="middle" widths="40% 54%" margins="0%">
			<stack>

			The process is similar with the formulas. For the first step we have:

			<md>

			<mrow>A\amp=\$82,894.07\left(1+\frac{0.10}{12}\right)^{12\cdot 20}</mrow>
			<mrow>\amp\approx\$607,453.85</mrow>
		</md>
		</p>

		<p>
			Now for Scenario 2: Since we are not investing anything for the first 15 years there is nothing to calculate. This is a one-step problem. We will find the future value with the monthly payments of $200 for 20 years. With a spreadsheet we enter
		</p>

		</md>
		</p>
		<p>
			Were you surprised by these numbers? You would put in less money in scenario 1 and end up with four times as much. The key to compounding interest is to start early. If you remember the graph of compound interest in <xref ref="financial_math_simple_compound"></xref>, we can see that as time goes on, the balance increases exponentially.

	<title>Deriving the Savings Plan Formula (Optional)</title>
	<p>
		If you are interested in where the savings plan formula came from, we will explain it here. A savings plan with regular payments can be described recursively. Recall that basic compound interest follows from the relationship for each compound period.
	</p>
	<p>
		<m>A=P\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)</m>
	</p>

	<p>
		For a savings plan, we need to add a deposit, d, to the account with each compounding period:
	</p>

	<p>
		<m>A=P\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)+d</m>
	</p>

	<p>
		Taking this equation from recursive form to explicit form is a bit trickier than with compound interest. It will be easiest to see by working with an example rather than working in general.
	</p>
	<p>
		Suppose we will deposit $100 each month into an account paying 6% APR. We assume that the account is compounded with the same frequency as we make deposits unless stated otherwise.
	</p>
	<p>
		In this example:
	</p>
	<p>
		<m>r=0.06</m>, 6% APR
	</p>

	<p>
		<m>n=12</m>, 12 compounds/deposits per year
	</p>

	<p>
		<m>d=\$100</m>, our deposit per month
	</p>

	<p>
		Writing out the recursive equation gives where A is exchanged with <m>P_{m}</m> where <em>m</em> is the number of compounding periods.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<m>P_{m}=\left(1+\frac{0.06}{12}\right)P_{m-1}+100=(1.005)P_{m-1}+100</m>
	</p>
	<p>
		Assuming we start with an empty account, we can begin using this relationship:
	</p>
	<p>
		<m>P_{0}=0</m>
	</p>
	<p>
		<m>P_{1}=(1.005)P_{0}+100=100</m>
	</p>
	<p>
		<m>P_{2}=(1.005)P_{1}+100=(1.005)(100)+100=100(1.005)+100</m>
	</p>
	<p>
		<m>P_{3}=(1.005)P_{2}+100=(1.005)(100(1.005)+100)+100=100(1.005)^{2}+100(1.005)+100</m>
	</p>
	<p>
		Continuing this pattern, after m deposits, we'd have saved:
	</p>

	<p>
		<m>P_{m}=100(1.005)^{m-1}+100(1.005)^{m-2}+...+100(1.005)+100</m>
	</p>

	<p>
		In other words, after <m>m</m> months, the first deposit will have earned compound interest for <m>m-1</m> months. The second deposit will have earned interest for <m>m-2</m> months. Last month's deposit would have earned only one month worth of interest. The most recent deposit will have earned no interest yet.
	</p>

	<p>
		This equation leaves a lot to be desired, though ‚Äì it doesn't make calculating the ending balance any easier! To simplify things, multiply both sides of the equation by 1.005:
	</p>
	<p>
		<m>1.005P_{m}=1.005[100(1.005)^{m-1}+100(1.005)^{m-2}+...+100(1.005)+100]</m>
	</p>

	<p>
		Distributing on the right side of the equation gives
	</p>
	<p>
		<m>1.005P_{m}=100(1.005)^{m}+100(1.005)^{m-1}+...+100(1.005)^{2}+100(1.005)</m>
	</p>
	<p>
		Now we'll line this up with like terms from our original equation, and subtract each side
	</p>
	<p>
		<m>1.005P_{m}=100(1.005)^{m}+100(1.005)^{m-1}+...+ 100(1.005)</m>
	</p>
	<p>
		<m>P_{m} = 100(1.005)^{m-1}+...+ 100(1.005)+100</m>
	</p>

	<p>
		Almost all the terms cancel on the right side when we subtract, leaving
	</p>

	<p>
		<m>1.005P_{m}-P_{m}=100(1.005)^{m}-100</m>
	</p>
	<p>
		Solving for <m>P_{m}</m>
	</p>
	<p>
		<m>0.005P_{m}=100((1.005)^{m}-1)</m>
	</p>
	<p>
		<m>P_{m}=\frac{100(1.005)^{m}-100}{0.005}</m>
	</p>
	<p>
		Replacing <m>P_{m}</m> with <m>A</m> (Future Value), <m>m</m> months with <m>12t</m>, where <m>t</m> is measured in years, gives
	</p>
	<p>
		<m>A=\frac{100\left((1.005)^{12t}-1\right)}{0.005}</m>
	</p>

	<p>
		Recall <m>0.005</m> was <m>r/n</m> and 100 was the deposit <m>d</m>. The value 12 as <m>n</m>, the number of deposits each year. Generalizing this result, we get the savings plan formula solved for <m>A</m>. The second formula uses algebra to rearrange the formula to be solved for <m>d</m>.
