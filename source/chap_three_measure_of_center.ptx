<subsection>
<title>Calculating Summary Statistics</title>
	<p>
		In addition to graphical and verbal descriptions, we can use numbers to summarize quantitative distributions. We want to know what an <q>average</q> value is (where the data is centered), and how spread out the values are. Together, the center and spread provide important information which can be used to estimate our population parameters. In this section we will discuss the measures of center and in the next section we will discuss the measures of spread.
	</p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>Measures of Center</title>
	<p>
		There are a few different types of <q>averages</q> that measure the center, and the one we use will depend on the shape of the distribution. We will mention the mode but focus mainly on the two most common <q>averages</q>: the <alert>mean</alert> and the <alert>median</alert>.
	</p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>Mode</title>
	<p>
		In the previous section, we saw that the modes are related to the peaks where similar values are grouped. The mode is the value with the highest frequency (A mode is the value where a peak occurs. One additional way to calculate the mode(s) is to take the midpoint of each peak in the histogram.)
	</p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>Mean</title>
	<p>
		The <alert>mean</alert>, or more formally the arithmetic mean, is what probably comes to mind when you hear the word average. The calculation of the mean uses every data value in the distribution and is therefore strongly affected by skew and outliers.
	</p>
	<p>
		To calculate the mean of a distribution, we divide the sum of the data values by the number of data values we have. The sample mean is usually represented by, a lower-case with a bar over it, read-bar. The lower-case letter n is used to represent the number of data values or <alert>sample size</alert>.
	</p>
	<assemblage>
	<title>Mean</title>
		<p>
			<me>\bar{x}=\frac{\text{sum of data values}}{n}</me>
		</p>
	</assemblage>
	
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Mirabel's exam scores for her last math class were: 79, 86, 82, and 94. What is her mean test score?
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
		<p>
			To find the mean test score we need to find the sum of her test scores, then divide the sum by the number of test scores (<m>n=4</m>). The mean is:
		</p>
		<p>
			<m>\bar{x}=\frac{79+86+82+94}{4}=85.25</m> points
		</p>
		<p>
			We will round the sample mean to one more decimal place than the original data. In this case, we would round 85.25 to 85.3 points. Also notice that the mean has the same units as the data and it is important to label it.
		</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<p>
		It is reasonable to calculate the mean by hand when the data set is small, but if the data set is large, or if you will be finding additional statistics, then technology is the way to go. We can find the mean of a data set using the spreadsheet formula <c>=AVERAGE</c>.
	</p>
	<example>
		<p>
			The price of peanut butter in dollars at 5 stores was 3.29, 3.59, 3.79, 3.75, and 3.99. Find the mean price using a spreadsheet.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are two ways to use the <c>=AVERAGE</c> formula. If your data set is not too large, you can enter each value directly into the formula. Using this method, we write
		</p>
		<p>
			<cd>=AVERAGE(3.29 3.59, 3.79, 3.75, 3.99)</cd>
		</p>
		
		<sidebyside width="50%">
			<image source="images/statistics/3_3/mean1.png">
			<shortdescription>A screenshot of Excel showing the =AVERAGE formula typed in with the values.</shortdescription>
			</image>
		</sidebyside>
		<p>
			and we get an answer of $3.68.
		</p>

		<p>
			The other method is to enter the data values into a single column (or row) of the spreadsheet and reference the column (or row) range in the formula. We can enter the range by highlighting the data values. As illustrated below, if we enter the data into column A, the formula is
		</p>
		<p>
			<cd>=AVERAGE(A1:A5)</cd>
		</p>
		<sidebyside width="50%">
			<image source="images/statistics/3_3/mean2.png">
			<shortdescription>A screenshot of Excel showing the =AVERAGE formula typed in with the cell references. The data is in column A</shortdescription>
			</image>
		</sidebyside>
		<p>
			and we also get an answer of $3.68.
		</p>
	</example>

	<p>
		Sometimes when there is a lot of data with repeated values we are given a frequency table.
	</p>
	<example>
		<p>
			One hundred families from a particular neighborhood are randomly selected and asked to give their annual household income rounded to the nearest $5,000. The results are shown in the frequency table below.
		</p>
			<tabular row-headers="yes" halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
				<row header="yes">
					<cell><line>Income</line><line>(thousands of dollars)</line></cell>
					<cell>Frequency</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell>$15</cell>
					<cell>6</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell>$20</cell>
					<cell>8</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell>$25</cell>
					<cell>11</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell>$30</cell>
					<cell>17</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell>$35</cell>
					<cell>19</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell>$40</cell>
					<cell>20</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell>$45</cell>
					<cell>12</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell>$50</cell>
					<cell>7</cell>
				</row>
			</tabular>
		<p>
			Calculating the mean by hand could get tedious if we try to type in all 100 values:
		</p>

		<p>
			<md>
				<mrow>\bar{x}=\frac{\overbrace{15+ \cdot + 15}^{6 \text{ terms}} + \overbrace{20+ \cdot + 20}^{8 \text{ terms}} + \overbrace{25 + \cdot + 25}^{11 \text{ terms}} + \cdot}{100}</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>
		<p>
			We could calculate this more easily by noticing that adding 15 to itself six times is the same as <m>(15)(6)=90</m>. Using this simplification, we get
		</p>
		<p>
			<md>
				<mrow>\bar{x}\amp=\frac{(15)(6)+(20)(8)+(25)(11)+(30)(17)+(35)(19)+(40)(20)+(45)(21)+(50)(7)}{100}</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp=\frac{3390}{100}</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp=33.9</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>
		<p>
			The mean household income of our sample is 33.9 thousand dollars or $33,900.
		</p>
	</example>

	<p>
		We could also use <c>=AVERAGE</c> to find the mean for this example, but it would require entering each repeated value individually. If the mean is all we need, then taking advantage of multiplication as repeated addition is the more straightforward way to go. We could also enter the frequency table and the calculation above in a spreadsheet.
	</p>
	<example>
		<p>
			Extending the last example, suppose a new family moves into the neighborhood and has a household income of $5 million ($5000 thousand). Adding this to our sample, our mean becomes:
		</p>
		<p>
			<md>
				<mrow>\bar{x}\amp=\frac{(15)(6)+(20)(8)+(25)(11)+(30)(17)+(35)(19)+(40)(20)+(45)(12)+(50)(7)+(5000)(1)}{100}</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp=\frac{8390}{101}</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp=83.069</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>
		<p>
			While 83.1 thousand dollars, or $83,100 is the correct mean household income for the new sample, it is no longer representative of the neighborhood – in fact, it is greater than every income in the sample aside from the new one we added!
		</p>
	</example>

	<p>
		Imagine the data values on a see-saw or balance scale. The mean is the value at the tip of the triangle that keeps the data in balance, like in the picture below.
	</p>
	<sidebyside width="60%">
		<image source="images/statistics/3_3/mean3.png">
		<shortdescription>A drawing of a see-saw with rectangles to indicate the data values. Most of the data values are to the left of the fulcrum; the two values to the right are spread out which causes the data to be balanced.</shortdescription>
		</image>
	</sidebyside>

	<p>
		If we graph our household data, the $5 million value is so far out to the right that the mean has to adjust to keep things in balance.
	</p>
	<sidebyside width="60%">
		<image source="images/statistics/3_3/mean4.png">
		<shortdescription>With the outlier data value added, the see-saw is extended with that value far to the right. Now all of the original data values are to the left of the fulcrum.</shortdescription>
		</image>
	</sidebyside>

	<p>
		For this reason, when working with data that is skewed or has outliers, it is common to use a different measure of center, the median.
	</p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
	<title>Median</title>
	<p>
		The <alert>median</alert> of a data set is the <q>middle</q> value, when the data are listed in order from smallest to largest. We can also think of the median as the value that has 50% of the data below it and 50% of data above it. As we will discover later, the median is also the <alert>50th percentile</alert>.
	</p>
	<assemblage>
		<title>Median</title>
		<p>
			If the number of data values is odd, then the median is the middle data value If the number of data values is even, then the median is the mean of the middle pair
		</p>
	</assemblage>

	<example>
		<p>
			Finding the median of an odd number of values.
		</p>
		<p>
			Use the following quiz scores in points:
		</p>
		<p>
				<tabular halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
					<row>
						<cell>5</cell>
						<cell>10</cell>
						<cell>8</cell>
						<cell>6</cell>
						<cell>4</cell>
						<cell>8</cell>
						<cell>2</cell>
						<cell>5</cell>
						<cell>7</cell>
						<cell>7</cell>
						<cell>6</cell>
					</row>
				</tabular>
		</p>
		<p>
			We must start by listing the data in order:
		</p>
		<p>
				<tabular halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
					<row>
						<cell>2</cell>
						<cell>4</cell>
						<cell>5</cell>
						<cell>5</cell>
						<cell>6</cell>
						<cell>6</cell>
						<cell>7</cell>
						<cell>7</cell>
						<cell>8</cell>
						<cell>8</cell>
						<cell>10</cell>
					</row>
				</tabular>
		</p>
		<p>
			It is helpful to mark or cross off the numbers as you list them to make sure you don't miss any. Also, be sure to count the number of data values in your ordered list to make sure it matches the number of data values in the original list.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this example there are 11 quiz scores. When the distribution contains an odd number of data values there will be a single number in the middle and that is the median. For small data sets, we can “walk” one value at a time from the ends of the ordered list towards the center to find the median
		</p>
		<p>
			<md>
				<mrow>\overbrace{2,4,5,5,6}^{\text{Lower Half}} \overbrace{6}^{\text{Median}} \overbrace{7,7,8,8,10}^{\text{Upper Half}}</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>
		<p>
			The median test score is 6 points.
		</p>
		
	</example>
	<example>
		<p>
			Finding the median of an even number of values.
		</p>
		<p>
			Use the following quiz scores in points:
		</p>
		<p>
				<tabular halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
					<row>
						<cell>2</cell>
						<cell>4</cell>
						<cell>5</cell>
						<cell>5</cell>
						<cell>6</cell>
						<cell>6</cell>
						<cell>7</cell>
						<cell>7</cell>
						<cell>8</cell>
						<cell>8</cell>
						<cell>10</cell>
						<cell>20</cell>
					</row>
				</tabular>
		</p>
		<p>
			There are now 12 quiz scores in our sample. When the distribution contains an even number of data values there will be a pair of values in the middle rather than a single value. Then we take the average of the middle two values.
		</p>
		<p>
			<md>
				<mrow>\overbrace{2,4,5,5,6}^{\text{Lower Half}} \overbrace{6, 7}^{\text{Middle Pair}} \overbrace{7,8,8,10,20}^{\text{Upper Half}}</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>
		<p>
			Median<m>=\frac{6+7}{2}=6.5</m> points
		</p>
		<p>
			Notice that despite adding an outlier to our data set, the median is largely unaffected. The median quiz score for the new distribution is 6.5 points. The median is not as affected by outliers as the mean is.
		</p>
		<p>
			We can also find the median using the spreadsheet formula <c>=MEDIAN</c>. Just like the spreadsheet function <c>=AVERAGE</c>, we can either list the individual data values in the formula, or we can enter the data values into a row (or column) and use the row range (or column range) in the formula.
		</p>
		<p>
			Using the data values of the original distribution, we can write the function as
		</p>
		<p>
			<cd>=MEDIAN(2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10)</cd> or
		</p>
		<p>
			<cd>=MEDIAN(A1:AK)</cd>
		</p>
		<sidebyside width="50%">

			<shortdescription>A screenshot of Excel showing the =MEDIAN formula typed in with the cell references. The data is in row 1</shortdescription>
			</image>
		</sidebyside>
		<p>
			and we get 6 points for the median test score.
		</p>
	</example>

<example>
	<p>
		Let's continue with our peanut butter example and find the median both by hand and with a spreadsheet. The price of peanut butter at 5 stores in dollars was:
	</p>
	<p>
			<tabular halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
				<row>
					<cell>3.29</cell>
					<cell>3.59</cell>
					<cell>3.79</cell>
					<cell>3.75</cell>
					<cell>3.99</cell>
				</row>
			</tabular>
	</p>
	<p>
		To find the median by hand, we must first list the prices in order. This give us:
	</p>
	<p>
			<tabular halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
				<row>
					<cell>3.29</cell>
					<cell>3.59</cell>
					<cell>3.75</cell>
					<cell>3.79</cell>
					<cell>3.99</cell>
				</row>
			</tabular>
	</p>
	<p>
		Since there are an odd number of data values in the sample (<m>n=5</m>), we know that the median will be the single data value in the middle of the ordered list.
	</p>
	<p>
		<md>
			<mrow>\overbrace{3.29, 3.59, }^{\text{Lower Half}} \text{ } \overbrace{ 3.75, }^{\text{Median}} \text{ } \overbrace{3.79, 3.99}^{\text{Upper Half}}</mrow>
		</md>
	</p>
	<p>
		The median price of peanut butter at these five stores is $3.75.
	</p>
	<p>
		Using a spreadsheet, we write
	</p>
	<p>
		<cd>=MEDIAN(3.29, 3.59, 3.79, 3.75, 3.99)</cd>
	</p>

		<shortdescription>A screenshot of Excel showing the =MEDIAN formula with all the data values typed in.</shortdescription>
		</image>
	</sidebyside>
	<p>
		and we get a median price of $3.75.
	</p>
</example>

	<p>
		It is worth noting that when you use a spreadsheet to find the median you do not have to order the data first. You can enter the data values in the order they are given to you.

<subsection>
	<title>The Relationship Between the Mean and the Median</title>
	<p>
		If a distribution is skewed, the mean is pulled in the direction of the skew, as we saw in the see-saw diagram. In a right skewed distribution, the mean is greater than the median, while in a left skewed distribution, the mean is less than the median. If the distribution is symmetric, the mean and the median will be approximately equal.
	</p>
	<p>
		To demonstrate this, we have entered some data in GeoGebra, as previously explained, and made histograms. To see the statistics that GeoGebra calculates, we click on the summation symbol <m>(\sum x)</m> on the right-hand menu bar.
	</p>
	<example>
		<p>
			Fifty people from the Portland Metro area who are employed full time were sampled and their annual salaries were recorded (to the nearest thousand dollars). The histogram and summary statistics from GeoGebra are shown below.
		</p>
		<p>
			From the histogram we can see that the shape of the distribution is unimodal and skewed to the right. We can see from the statistics output on the left that the mean is greater than the median. This is because the few people with higher incomes bring the average up.
		</p>

	</example>

	<example>
		<p>
			A random selection of 30 math 105 exams at PCC were sampled and their scores were recorded. The histogram of the resulting distribution is shown below. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The shape of the distribution is unimodal and skewed to the left. There also appears to be an outlier between 20 and 30. We can see from the statistics output that the mean is less than the median. This is because the low test score brought the average down. points points

	<example>
		<p>
			Nineteen people identifying as female were sampled and their heights (in inches) were recorded. The histogram of the resulting distribution is shown below. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The shape of the distribution is unimodal and roughly symmetric. We can also see from the statistics output that the mean and the median are approximately equal. inches inches

			</image>
		</figure>
	</example>

<p>
	We can use these observations in reverse as well. If we know the mean is greater than the median, then we can expect the distribution to be skewed to the right. If the mean is less than the median, then we can expect the distribution to be skewed to the left. When the mean and the median are approximately equal, the distribution is likely to be symmetric.
</p>
<example>
	<statement>
	<p>
		Recent college graduates were asked how much student loan debt they have. The data has a mean of $46,265 and a median of $33,652. Just based on this information, do you expect the distribution to be symmetric, skewed to the left, or skewed to the right?
	</p>
	</statement>
	<solution>
	<p>
		Since the mean is greater than the median, we can expect the distribution to be skewed to the right.

Therefore, none of the graphs are skewed. The felt smile group is the most visually uniform.

					Each graph would have frequency along the y-axis. In a bar graph the bars would have spaces between them and each bar would be labeled with the shoe size. In a histogram there would not be any spaces between the bars and the shoe sizes could be the scale on the x-axis.

					The mean and median shoe size might be useful statistics to the store. If shoe size is positively correlated to height, then a shoe store with a comparatively larger mean or median shoe size could determine that their clients are, on average, comparatively taller. (Other answers are possible.)

	<solution>
	<p>
		<ol marker="a.">
			<li>
				<p>
					Incomes are skewed to the right so the mean would be greater than the median.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Weights are approximately symmetric so the mean would be about the same as the median.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Number of children is skewed to the right so the mean would be greater than the median.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Medical costs for all adults are most likely skewed to the right so the mean would be greater than the median.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Medical costs for adults 65+ may be symmetric or skewed to the right. Answer according to the shape you chose.
