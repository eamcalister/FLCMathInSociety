<subsection>
	<title>Sets</title>
	<p>
		It is natural for us to classify items into groups, or <term>sets</term>, and consider how they interact with each other. In this section, we will use sets and Venn diagrams to visualize relationships between groups and represent survey data.
	</p>
	<p>
		A <term>set</term> is a collection of items or things. Each item in a set is called a <term>member</term> or an <term>element</term>.
	</p>
	<example>
		<p>
			<ol marker="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						The numbers 2 and 42 are elements of the set of all even numbers.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						MTH 105 is a member of the set of all courses you are taking.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
	</example>
	<p>
		A set consisting entirely of elements of another set is called a <term>subset</term>. For instance, the set of numbers 2, 6, and 10 is a subset of the set of all even numbers.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some sets, like the set of even numbers, can be defined by simply describing their contents. We can also define a set by listing its elements using <term>set notation</term>.
	</p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
	<title>Set Notation</title>
	<p>
		<term>Set notation</term> is used to define the contents of a set. Sets are usually named using a capital letter, and its elements are listed <em>once</em> inside a set of curly brackets.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, to write the set of primary colors using set notation, we could name the set <em>C</em> for colors, and list the names of the primary colors in brackets: <em>C = {red, yellow, blue}</em>. In this case, the set <em>C</em> is a subset of all colors. If we wanted to write the list of our favorite foods using set notation, we could write <em>F = {cheese, raspberries, wine}</em>. And yes, wine is definitely an element of some food group!
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Julia, Keenan, Jae and Colin took a test. They got the following scores: 70, 95, 85 and 70. Let P be the set of test takers and S be the set of test scores. List the elements of each set using set notation.
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				In this example, the set of people taking the test is <em>P</em> = {Julia, Keenan, Jae, Colin}, and the set of test scores is <em>S</em> = {70, 85, 95}. Notice in this example that even though two people scored a 70 on the test, the score of 70 is only listed once.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>
	<p>
		It is important to note that when we write the elements of a set in set notation, there is no order implied. For example, the set {1, 2, 3} is equivalent to the set {3, 1, 2}. It is conventional, however, to list the elements in order if there is one. 
	</p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
	<title>Universal Set</title>
	<p>
		The <term>universal set</term> is the set containing every possible element of the described context. Every set is therefore a subset of the universal set. The universal set is often illustrated by a rectangle labeled with a capital letter <em>U</em>. Subsets of the universal set are usually illustrated with circles for simplicity, but other shapes can be used.
	</p>
	<example>
		<p>
		<ol marker="a.">
			<li>
				<sidebyside valign="middle" width="40%">
					<p>
						If you are searching for books for a research project, the universal set might be all the books in the library, and the books in the library that are relevant to your research project would be a subset of the universal set.
					</p>
					<image source="images/language_logic_rules/1_2/UV_set_pic1.png">
					<shortdescription>A rectangle is drawn for the universal set U, labeled all books in the library; there is a circle inside the rectangle, labeled books relevant to your research project.</shortdescription>
					</image>
				</sidebyside>
			</li>
			<li>
				<sidebyside valign="middle" width="40%">
					<p>
						If you are wanting to create a group of your Facebook friends that are coworkers, the universal set would be all your Facebook friends and the group of coworkers would be a subset of the universal set.
					</p>
					<image source="images/language_logic_rules/1_2/UV_set_pic2.png">
					<shortdescription>A rectangle is drawn for the universal set U, labeled all your facebook friends; there is a circle inside the rectangle, labeled coworkers.</shortdescription>
					</image>
				</sidebyside>
			</li>
			<li>
				<sidebyside valign="middle" width="40%">
					<p>
						If you are working with sets of numbers, the universal set might be all whole numbers, and all prime numbers would be a subset of the universal set.
					</p>
					<image source="images/language_logic_rules/1_2/UV_set_pic3.png">
					<shortdescription>A rectangle is drawn for the universal set U, labeled all whole numbers; there is a circle inside the rectangle, labeled all whole numbers.</shortdescription>

			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	</example>
</subsection>

<subsection>
	<title>The Null Set</title>
	<p>
		It is possible to have a set with nothing in it. This set called the <term>null set</term> or <term>empty set</term>. It's like going to the grocery store to buy your favorite foods and realizing you left your wallet at home. You walk away with an empty bag. The set of items that you bought at the grocery store would written in set notation as <em>G = { }</em>, or <em>G = Ã˜</em>. 
	</p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
	<title>Intersection, Union, and Complement (And, Or, Not)</title>
	<p>
		Suppose you and your roommate decide to have a house party, and you each invite your circle, or set, of friends. When you combine your two sets of friends, you discover that you have some friends in common.
	</p>
	<p>
		The set of friends that you have in common is called the <term>intersection</term>. The intersection of two sets contains only the elements that are in both sets. To be in the intersection of set <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, an element needs to be in both set <em>A</em> <term>and</term> set <em>B</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The set of all friends that you and your roommate have invited is called the <term>union</term>. The union of two sets contains all the elements contained in either set (or both). To be in the union of set <em>A</em> and set <em>B</em>, an element must to be contained in just set <em>A</em>, just set <em>B</em>, <alert>or</alert> in the intersection of sets <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>. Notice that in this case that the <q>or</q> is inclusive.
	</p>
	<p>
		What about the people who were <em>not</em> invited to the party and showed up anyway? They are not elements of your set of invited friends. Nor are they an element of your roommate's set of invited friends. These uninvited party crashers are the <term>complement</term> to your set of invited friends. The complement of a set <em>A</em> contains everything that is <em>not</em> in the set <em>A</em>. To be in the complement of set <em>A</em>, an element <alert>cannot</alert> be in set <em>A</em>, but it will be an element of the universal set.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Consider the sets: <em>A</em> = {red, green, blue}, <em>B</em> = {red, yellow, orange}, and <em>C</em> = {red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple}
			<ol marker="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						Determine the set <em>A</em> intersect <em>B</em>, and write it in set notation.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Determine the set <em>A</em> union <em>B</em>, and write it in set notation.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Determine the intersection of <em>A</em> complement and <em>C</em> and write it in set notation. 
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				<ol marker="a.">
					<li>
						<p>
							The intersection contains the elements in both sets: <em>A</em> intersect <em>B</em> = {red}
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The union contains all the elements in either set: <em>A</em> union <em>B</em> = {red, green, blue, yellow, orange}. Notice we only list red once.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Here we are looking for all the elements that are <em>not</em> in set <em>A</em> and are in set <em>C</em>: <em>A</em> complement intersect <em>C</em> = {orange, yellow, purple} 
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>

	<title>Venn Diagrams</title>
	<p>
	 	<term>Venn diagrams</term> are used to illustrate the relationships between two or more sets. To create a Venn diagram, start by drawing a rectangle to represent the universal set. Next draw and label overlapping circles to represent each of your sets. Most often there will be two or three sets illustrated in a Venn diagram. Finally, if you are given elements, fill in each region with its corresponding elements. Venn diagrams are also a great way to illustrate intersections, unions and complements of sets as shown below.
	</p>
		<sidebyside width="30%">

	<p>
		Here is an example of how to draw a Venn Diagram.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Let <em>J</em> be the set of books Julio read this summer and let <em>R</em> be the set of books Rose read this summer. Draw a Venn diagram to show the sets of books they read if Julio read Game of Thrones, Animal Farm and 1984, and Rose read The Hobbit, 1984, The Tipping Point, and Greek Love.
		</p>
		<p>
			To create a Venn diagram showing the relationship between the set of books Julio read and the set of books Rose read, first draw a rectangle to illustrate the universal set of all books.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next draw two overlapping circles, one for the set of books Julio read and one for the set of books Rose read. Since both Rose and Julio read 1984, we place it in the overlapping region (the intersection).
		</p>
		<p>
			All the books that Rose read will lie in her circle, in one of the two regions that make up her set. Likewise for the books Julio read. Since we have already filled in the overlapping region, we put the books that only Rose read in her circle's <q>cresent moon</q> section, and we put the books that only Julio read in his circle's <q>cresent moon</q> section. The resulting diagram is shown below.
		</p>
		<sidebyside width="40%">
		<image source="images/language_logic_rules/1_2/Venn_pic4.png">

	<example>
		<p>
			In the last section we discussed the difference between <alert>inclusive <q>or</q></alert> and <alert>exclusive <q>or.</q></alert> In common language, <q>or</q> is usually exclusive, meaning the set <em>A</em> or <em>B</em> includes just <em>A</em> or just <em>B</em> but not both. In logic, however, <q>or</q> is inclusive, so the set <em>A</em> or <em>B</em> includes just <em>A</em>, just <em>B</em>, or both. The difference between the inclusive and exclusive <q>or</q> can be illustrated in a Venn, as shown below.

<subsection>
	<title>Illustrating Data</title>
	<p>
		We can also use Venn diagrams to illustrate quantities, data, or frequencies.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			A survey asks 200 people, <q>What beverage(s) do you drink in the morning?</q> and offers three choices: tea only, coffee only, and both coffee and tea. Thirty report drinking only tea in the morning, 80 report drinking only coffee in the morning, and 40 report drinking both. How many people drink tea in the morning? How many people drink neither tea nor coffee?
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
		<p>
			To answer this question, let's first create a Venn diagram representing the survey results. Placing the given values, we have the following:
		</p>
		<sidebyside width="85%">
		<image source="images/language_logic_rules/1_2/ill_data1.png">
		<shortdescription>A Venn diagram with 2 overlapping sets, labeled coffee and tea; There are 80 people in the crescent for only coffee only, 30 people in the crescent for only tea, and 40 in the overlapping region in the center for coffee and tea</shortdescription>
		</image>
		</sidebyside>
		<p>
			The universal set should include all 200 people surveyed, but we only have 150 placed so far. The difference between what we have placed so far, and the 200 total is the number of people who drink neither coffee nor tea. These 200 â€“ 150 = 50 people are placed outside of the circles but within the rectangle since they are still included in the universal set.
		</p>
		<p>
			The number of people who drink tea in the morning includes everyone in the tea circle. This includes those who only drink tea and those who drink both tea and coffee. Thus, the number of people who drink tea is 40 + 30 = 70.
		</p>
		<sidebyside width="40%">
		<image source="images/language_logic_rules/1_2/ill_data2.png">
		<shortdescription>The same Venn digram with the number 50 placed outside of the circles and inside the universal set. These are the people who don't drink tea or coffee</shortdescription>

	</example>

	<p>
		Here is an example of a Venn diagram with three sets.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			In a survey, adults were asked how they travel to work. Below is the recorded data on how many people took the bus, biked, and/or drove to work. Draw and label a Venn diagram using the information in the table.
		</p>
			<tabular halign="left" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">

			</tabular>
		</statement>
		<solution>
		<p>
			To fill in the Venn diagram, we will place the 157 people who only drive a car in the car set where it does not overlap with any other modes of transportation. We can fill in the numbers 20 and 35 in a similar way.
		</p>

		<p>
			Then we have the overlap of two modes of transportation only. There are 35 people who use their car and bike only, so they go in the overlap of those two sets, but they do not take the bus, so they are outside of the bus set. Similarly, we can enter the 10 and 8. There are 12 people who use all three modes, so they are in the intersection of all three sets. There are 15 people who do not use any of the three modes, so they are placed outside the circles but inside the universal set of all modes of transportation. Here is the completed Venn diagram.

			One hundred fifty people were surveyed and asked if they believed in UFOs, ghosts, and Bigfoot. The following results were recorded.
			<ul>
				<li>

			Draw and label a Venn diagram to determine how many people believed in at least two of these things.

		</statement>
		<solution>
		<p>
			Starting with the intersection of all three circles, we work our way out. The number in the center is 2, since two people believe in UFO's, ghosts and Bigfoot. Since 10 people believe in UFOs and Ghosts, and that includes the 2 that believe in all three, that leaves 8 that believe in only UFOs and Ghosts.
		</p>
		<p>
			We work our way out, filling in all the regions. Once we have, we can add up all those regions, getting 91 people in the union of all three sets. This leaves 150 â€“ 91 = 59 who believe in none.

	<title>Qualified Propositions</title>
	<p>
		A <term>qualified proposition</term> is a statement that asserts a relationship between two sets. The three relationships we will be looking at in this section are <q>some</q> (some elements are shared between the two sets), <q>none</q> (none of the elements are shared between the two sets), and <q>all</q> (all elements of one set are contained in the other set). These relationships are especially important in evaluating arguments.
