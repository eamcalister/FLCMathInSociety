<subsection>
<title>Choosing the U.S. President</title>
	<p>
		In the last section we talked about equal voting rights and studied several voting methods. To choose the President of the United States, we use another method, called the <alert>Electoral College</alert>. The Founders, with their newfound freedom from Britain, wanted to create a democracy where citizens could participate in choosing their president. Prior to the Electoral College, there were three options proposed (Best, 2004; Clayton, 2015). They were
		<ol marker="1.">
			<li>
				<p>
					Congress would elect the president
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					State Legislatures would vote and elect the president
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The people would elect a president by popular vote
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		The first option of having Congress do this work was declined as this would alter the balance of power among the three separate branches of government. The idea to have State Legislatures also failed as there wouldn't be the separation between having an independent Federal Government and State Governments.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <alert>popular vote</alert> means a candidate must win a plurality of all the votes cast for president, regardless of which state the voters live in. The popular vote was decided against as the Founders didn't think all citizens would be informed enough about the candidates to make an educated decision (Clayton, 2015).
	</p>
	<p>
		Instead, the <alert>Electoral College</alert> was decided upon and, in this system, each state was given a certain number of electoral votes. Each state got an equal two votes for the two senate seats. This gave smaller states a leg up as they would have at least these votes. In addition, each state would be given more votes based on their population, equal to their representation in the House (Clayton, 2015). The District of Columbia, which is not a state, also gets 3 electoral votes. A candidate must win a majority of the electoral votes to win the U.S. presidency. If no candidate has a majority of electoral votes then a contingent election would be held by the U.S. House of Representatives between the three candidates with the most electoral votes.
	</p>
	<p>
		The 4 million U.S. Citizens who live in the <alert>U.S. territories</alert> of Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands and Puerto Rico cannot vote in the presidential elections and do not have any electors for the U.S. President. Additionally, there are U.S. Nationals in American Samoa and other territories that cannot vote. You can learn more about residents of these territories in this Census Bureau Report<fn><url href="https://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/12statab/outlying.pdf"></url></fn>. We will also reiterate that <alert>voter suppression</alert> still exists and elections will not be truly fair until all of its forms are eliminated.
	</p>
	<p>
		As stated in the Constitution, the U.S. currently has 435 representatives in the House. They each serve 2-year terms, while the two senators from each state serve 6-year terms.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			How many electoral votes are there in the U.S. Electoral College?
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				<m>100+435+3=538</m>
			</p>
			<p>
				By adding all the U.S. Senators, Representatives and 3 for Washington, D.C., we have a total of 538 electoral votes.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			How many electoral votes does a candidate need to win to become the President of the United States?
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				<m>538\div2=269</m> then add one to get over 50%, which is 270.
			</p>
			<p>
				A candidate needs 270 electoral votes to win the U.S. Presidency.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			The number of people who voted in the presidential election in 2016 was 136,452,150 (Ballotpedia, n.d.). How many votes would be needed to win a majority of the popular vote?
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				<m>136,452,150\div2=68,226,075</m> then go to the next whole number which is 68,226,076.
			</p>
			<p>
				A candidate would need 68,226,076 votes to win the popular vote.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			There were approximately 230,931,921 eligible voters at the time of the 2016 election (McDonald, 2016). What percentage of eligible voters voted?
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				<m>136,452,150 \div 230,931,921 = 0.591</m>
			</p>
			<p>
				About 59% of all the eligible voters voted in the 2016 election.
			</p>
		</solution>

<subsection>
<title>How Electoral Votes are Determined</title>
	<p>
		While each state has a set number of electoral votes based on the formula above, the federal government gave states the control of how they distribute and cast their electoral votes (Paiva, 2011). In 48 states, the candidate with the most votes wins all of that state's electoral votes, often called <alert>winner-takes-all</alert>. In essence, a candidate could win with barely a majority of the popular vote in that state and the entire state's votes goes to that individual (Clayton, 2015). In 2 states, Maine and Nebraska, however, they use a district plan where instead of winner-takes-all, they use <alert>proportionality</alert>. This means that they award electoral votes by how individual districts vote. Each district gives their electoral vote to the winner of their district and the remaining two votes go to the candidate that won statewide.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is a movement to change from the Electoral College to the popular vote. One way this is happening is through the <alert>National Popular Vote Interstate Compact</alert><fn><url href="https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/"></url></fn>. States who adopt this compact agree to award their electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote. If states and/or D.C. with at least 270 electoral votes adopt this compact, then the winner of the popular vote would win the electoral college and the presidency. At this time there are 196 electoral votes in states and D.C. who have enacted the bill and the bill has passed one or two legislative houses in additional states with 88 electoral votes.
	</p>
	<p>
		After citizens cast their votes by mail or on election day on the first Tuesday in November, electors gather in December and are responsible for casting the votes for their state. Electors cannot be elected officials and are chosen by their parties. Electors are expected to vote in alignment with the state they represent, but there have been faithless electors in the past. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in July of 2020 that states can penalize electors who do not vote according to the law of the state.
	</p>
	<p>
		To see how the electoral college and popular votes work, we will look at a made-up country with a smaller number of states.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Consider this country with 4 states. The rules for the number of senators and electors are the same as the U.S. government. Each state will get 1 representative for every 40,000 residents. For simplicity we will ignore any remainders.

							Now we can see that Candidate A wins the popular vote with 1,011,073 votes compared to 849,072 for Candidate B. But Candidate B wins the Electoral College with 29 electoral votes. So, Candidate B becomes the President of the United States.

							From the table we find there are 8 different ways to win the electoral college and candidates should definitely campaign in Large and Huge.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							To find the fewest number of individual votes a candidate could win with; let's look at the table above. The combination of states with the fewest electoral votes is Huge and Small with 28 electoral votes. Let's see how many votes would be needed to win those two states.
						</p>
						<p>
							For Huge:
						</p>
						<p>
							<m>862,070 \div 2 = 431,035</m>, then go to the next whole number and get 431,036.
						</p>
						<p>
							For Small:
						</p>
						<p>
							<m>154,600 \div 2 = 77,300</m>, then go to the next whole number which is 77,301.
						</p>
						<p>
							<m>431,036+77,301 \text{ votes } = 508,337 \text{ votes}</m>
						</p>
						<p>
							Let's also consider the next larger combination of 29 electoral votes: winning Small, Large and Medium, because their populations are smaller than the Huge state.
						</p>
						<p>
							We found above that Small can be won with a bare majority of 77,301 people.
						</p>
						<p>
							For Medium:
						</p>
						<p>
							<m>262,340 \div 2 = 131,170</m>, then go to the next whole number which is 131,171.
						</p>
						<p>
							For Large:
						</p>
						<p>
							<m>581,135 \div 2 = 290,567.5</m>, then go to the next whole number which is 290,568.
						</p>
						<p>
							<m>77,301 + 131,171 + 290,568 \text{ votes } = 499,040 \text{ votes}</m>
						</p>
						<p>
							A candidate can win with 499,040 votes in the combination of the Small, Large and Medium state.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The smallest number of votes to win the electoral college is 499,040. What percentage of the population is that? We will divide by the total population to get
						</p>
						<p>
							<m>499,040 \div 1,860,145 = 0.2683.</m>
						</p>
						<p>
							If a candidate had the right combination of states in this made up country, they could win the Electoral College with only 26.8% of the vote.
						</p>

		People who support the Electoral College often say it protects small states. People who oppose the Electoral College often say that each person's vote should count equally as in the popular vote. Next we will look at electoral power to understand the impact of the Electoral College on people in small and large states.

<title>Electoral Power</title>
	<p>
		<alert>Electoral power</alert> is the value of a person's vote in one state compared to another state. A related topic is voting power, which is the probability of any one person influencing an election. If you are interested in voting power, you can look up the Banzhaf Power Index. To calculate the electoral power, we will calculate a ratio of electoral votes for a given number of people. We could use any number, so we will choose the number of people that each representative represents, which is our divisor of 40,000 people.
	</p>

			First, we fill in the number of representatives, senators and electoral votes for each state that we found earlier. Then we will calculate the number of electoral votes per 40,000 people.
		</p>
		<p>
			To do that, divide the number of electors by the number of representatives, since they each represent approximately 40,000 people. The results are shown in the table below. Note this is approximate because we cut off the decimal remainders when calculating the number of representatives.

			Are you surprised to see that the smallest states have the highest electoral power? That is part of the design of the electoral college. The founders from small states were concerned that their votes would not matter, so every state gets 2 senators added to the number of representatives. For a state with few representatives, those 2 extra electoral votes make a big difference. For a large states, the extra 2 electoral votes don't make a very big difference.
		</p>
		<p>
			You may have noticed a pattern when dividing to find the electoral power. Each time we divided the number of electoral votes by that number minus two. We can write that pattern as <m>\frac{n}{n-2}</m>. Using GeoGebra to graph that pattern this is what we see.
		</p>
		<sidebyside>
		<image width="70%" source="images/democracy/5_3/electoral1.png">
		<shortdescription>A cartesian coordinate graph with number of electors on the x-axis and electoral power on the y-axis. The graph shows the maximum electoral power of 3 when there are 3 electors and an exponential decay as the number of electors goes up. With 4 electors the electoral power is 2, with 5 electors the electoral power is about 1.67 and the pattern levels off at an electoral power just over 1.0 as the number of electors increases.</shortdescription>
		</image>
		</sidebyside>
		<p>
			The minimum number of electors is three, since each state gets at least one representative in the apportionment process. The smallest states and Washington, D.C. have 3 electors and the greatest electoral power on the left side of the graph. The largest states like California, Florida and Texas have the least electoral power on the right side of the graph.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's say instead each state had equal electoral power by removing the 2 extra electoral votes or by using the popular vote. Then the graph would look like this.
		</p>
		<sidebyside>
		<image width="70%" source="images/democracy/5_3/electoral2.png">
		<shortdescription>A cartesian coordinate graph with the same axes as the previous graph. This time the electoral power is constant with an electoral power of 1 for every number of electors.</shortdescription>
