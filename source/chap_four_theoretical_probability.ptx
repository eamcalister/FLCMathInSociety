<introduction>
	<p>
		As we saw in the last section, the <alert>probability</alert> of a specified event is the chance or likelihood that it will occur.Â We calculated empirical or experimental probabilities using contingency tables. In this section, we will focus on <alert>theoretical</alert> probability and compare the two types.

<subsection>
	<title>Basic Probability Concepts</title>
	<p>
		  Let's begin with a brief introduction to some of the language and basic concepts of theoretical probability.
	</p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
	<title>Experiment</title>
	<p>
		If you roll a die, pick a card from a deck of playing cards, or randomly select a person and observe their hair color, you are conducting an <alert>experiment</alert>. 
	</p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
	<title>Events and Outcomes</title>
	<p>
		The result of an experiment is an <alert>outcome</alert>. An <alert>event</alert> is any particular group of outcomes, like rolling a three or a five on a die. An event can be a <alert>simple event</alert>, which is a single outcome, or a combination of outcomes, called a <alert>compound event</alert>.
	</p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
	<title>Sample Space</title>
	<p>
		The <alert>sample space</alert> is the set of all possible outcomes. For example, if we roll a six-sided die, the sample space <em>S</em> is the set <m>S={1,2,3,4,5,6}</m>.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			If we roll an eight-sided die, describe the sample space and give at least two examples of simple events and compound events.
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
		<p>
			The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes, or equivalently, all simple events: <m>S={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}</m>
		</p>
		<p>
			Examples of simple events are rolling a 1, rolling a 5, rolling a 6, and so on. Examples of compound events include rolling an even number, rolling a 5 or a 3, and rolling a number that is at least 4.
		</p>
		</solution>
	</example>
</subsection>

<subsection>
	<title>Equally Likely Outcomes</title>
	<p>
		When the outcomes of an experiment are equally likely, we can calculate the probability of an event as the number of ways it can happen out of the total number of outcomes.
	</p>
	<assemblage>
		<title>Theoretical Probability</title>
		<p>
			<me>P(E)=\frac{\text{number of outcomes corresponding to the event E}}{\text{total number of equally-likely outcomes}}</me>
		</p>
	</assemblage>
	<p>
		We can write the result as a simplified fraction or as a decimal or percent.
	</p>

	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Write the sample space for the sum of two fair six-sided dice and determine whether the outcomes are equally likely. 
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
		<p>
			The sample space for the sum of two fair six-sided dice is <m>S={2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}</m>. The different sums, however, are not equally likely. If we look at a table of the different possible outcomes when rolling two dice, we see that there are 36 possible combinations. We will summarize this in a table by listing each outcome in the sample space. Then we find the probabilities by counting the number of ways each sum can occur and dividing it by 36.

	<p>
		From the probability table we can see that rolling a sum of 7 has the highest probability and rolling a 2 or a 12 have the lowest probabilities.
	</p>
	</solution>
	</example>

	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Suppose we roll a fair six-sided die. Calculate the probability of:
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						rolling a 6.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						rolling a number that is at least 4.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						rolling an even number.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						rolling a 5 or a 3.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
	</statement>
	<solution>
	<p>
		Recall that the sample space is <m>S={1,2,3,4,5,6}</m>. Since each of the outcomes in the sample space is equally likely, we can find the probability of each event by counting the number of outcomes corresponding to the event and dividing by 6, the total number of equally likely outcomes.
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>
					There is only one way to roll a 6, so <m>P(\text{rolling a 6}) =\frac{1}{6}</m> or approximately 16.7% There is a 16.7% chance of rolling a 6.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					In probability we will often come across the phrases <q>at least</q> and <q>at most.</q> <alert>At least</alert> means that value or greater. <alert>At most</alert> means that value or less. Since we are looking for the probability of rolling a number that is at least 4, we need the number of outcomes that are 4 or greater. There are 3 values that meet this condition: 4, 5, and 6. The probability is <m>P(\text{rolling a number that is at least 4})=\frac{3}{6}=\frac{1}{2}</m> or 50%
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Half of the numbers on a die are even, so we calculate: <m>P(\text{rolling an even number})=\frac{3}{6}=\frac{1}{2}</m> or 50%
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					There are two ways to roll a 5 or a 3, so <m>P(\text{rolling a 5 or a 3})=\frac{2}{6}=\frac{1}{3}</m> or approxiamtely 33.3%. There is a 33.3% chance of rolling a 5 or a 3.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
</solution>
</example>

<example>
	<statement>
	<p>
		Suppose you have a bag containing 14 sweet cherries and 6 sour cherries. If you pick a cherry at random, what is the probability it will be sweet?
	</p>
	</statement>
	<solution>
	<p>
		Each of the cherries are equally likely to be selected since our selection is random and we can assume there is no way to distinguish one cherry from another. This means that the probability of selecting a sweet cherry will be equal to the number of sweet cherries in the bag dived by the total number of cherries in the bag. Since there are 14 sweet cherries and a total of 20 cherries in the bag, we have:
	</p>
	<p>
		<md>
		<mrow>P(\text{sweet})=\frac{14}{20}=\frac{7}{10}\text{ or } 70\%</mrow>
	</md>
	</p>
	<p>
		There is a 70% chance of selecting a sweet cherry from the bag.
	</p>
</solution>
</example>
</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>Certain and Impossible Events</title>
	<p>
		A probability is always a value between 0 and 1, or from 0% to 100%. If the probability of an event is 0 there are no outcomes that correspond with that event and we say it is <alert>impossible</alert>. If the probability of an event is 1 then every outcome corresponds to that event and we say it is <alert>certain</alert>.
	</p>
	<example>
	<statement>
		<p>
			<ol marker="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						What is the probability of rolling an odd or even number on a six-sided die?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						What is the probability of rolling an 8 on a six-sided die?
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
	</statement>
	<solution>
		<p>
			<ol marker="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						Since all the numbers are either even or odd, this event includes all of the outcomes in the sample space. This event is certain. <m>P(\text{odd or even})=\frac{6}{6}=1\text{ or } 100\%</m>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Since 8 is not one of the outcomes in the sample space, the event is impossible. <m>P(\text{roll an 8})=\frac{0}{8}=0\text{ or } 0\%</m>
					</p>
				</li>	
			</ol>
		</p>
	</solution>
	</example>
</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>Complementary Events</title>
	<p>
		Just as we saw in the logic chapter, the <alert>complement</alert> of an event A means A does not happen. We can refer to the complement as <alert>not A</alert> or <m>A^{C}</m>. For example, consider the experiment of rolling a six-sided die and the simple event <alert>A</alert> = rolling a 6. The complement of event <alert>A</alert> is everything in the sample space that is not a 6: <m>A^{C} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}</m>. Recall that we can illustrate the complement using a Venn diagram as shown below.
	</p>
	<sidebyside width="30%">
		<image source="images/probability/4_2/comp_events.png">
		<shortdescription>A Venn diagram with only one set A; The region outside the circle for A but inside the rectangle is shaded blue to represent the complement of the set or elements not in set A.</shortdescription>
		</image>
	</sidebyside>
	<p>
		Notice that the outcomes from set A and the outcomes from set <m>A^{C}</m> will together equal the universal set, which is the sample space in probability. The probabilities must add up to 1 or 100%. Therefore, we can use subtraction to find the probability of a complement.
	</p>
	<assemblage>
	<title>Complement of an Event</title>
		<p>
			<me>P(A^{C})=1-P(A)</me>
		</p>
	</assemblage>

	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			If you roll an eight-sided die, what's the probability you don't get a 6?
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				Not rolling a 6 is the complement of rolling a 6, which is easier to calculate. Since there are 8 possible numbers to roll, we have:
			</p>
			<p>
				<md>
				<mrow>P(\text{not rolling a 6})=1-P(\text{rolling a 6})=1-\frac{1}{8}=\frac{7}{8}\text{ or } 0.875</mrow>
			</md>
			</p>
			<p>
				There is an 87.5% chance of not rolling a 6. 
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>
</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>Experimental vs. Theoretical Probability</title>
	<p>
		Now that we have calculated experimental and theoretical probabilities, we can compare them. When we flip a fair coin, we say there is a 50% chance of getting heads. This is a theoretical probability because there are two equally likely outcomes â heads and tails â so we expect to get heads half of the time. But if you flip a coin, say 100 times, will you get heads exactly 50 times? Maybe, but you are more likely to get some number around 50 times. The number of heads you actually observe out of the total number of times you flip the coin is the experimental probability.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			The table shows the numbers that came up after rolling a six-sided die 10 times. What is the experimental probability of rolling a 6? What is the theoretical probability of rolling a 6?
		</p>
		<tabular row-headers="yes" halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">

		</tabular>
		</statement>
		<solution>
		<p>
			To find the experimental probability of rolling a 6, it would be helpful to change this into a frequency table. We list all the possible outcomes and count how many times each occurred.
		</p>
		<tabular row-headers="yes" halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
			<row header="yes">
				<cell>Outcome</cell>

			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>6</cell>
				<cell>3</cell>
			</row>
		</tabular>
		<p>
			According to our frequency table, we see that a 6 was rolled three times, so the experimental probability of rolling a 6 is <m>P(\text{roll 6})=\frac{3}{10}</m> or 30%.
		</p>
		<p>
			Theoretically, however, we would expect the number 6 to come up 1 out of 6 times since there are 6 equally likely outcomes. Thus, the theoretical probability of rolling a 6 is <m>P(\text{roll 6})=\frac{1}{6}</m> or approximately 16.7%
		</p>
	</solution>
	</example>
</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>The Law of Large Numbers</title>
	<p>
		As we saw in the previous example, theoretical and experimental probabilities are not necessarily equal. However, experimental probability will eventually approach theoretical probability as we conduct more and more trials. This phenomenon is called the <alert>Law of Large Numbers</alert>. This means if you flip a fair coin a <insert>small number of times</insert>, the experimental probability is likely to be different each time and could be very different from the theoretical probability. But if you flip a coin a <insert>large number of times</insert>, the experimental probability becomes very close to the theoretical probability of 50%. The Law of Large Numbers is extremely powerful in that it allows us to approximate the theoretical probability of complex events â like changes in beliefs and opinions, likelihood of natural disasters, climate change effects â through repeated sampling and simulation. 
	</p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>Probability of Compound Events</title>
	<p>
		Now that we have the basics in place, let's look at some compound probability problems that we will be studying in this course. 
	</p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
<title><q>And</q> Probabilities</title>
	<p>
		As we saw with truth tables, the event <alert>A and B</alert> refers to an event where both <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> occur. These events may occur at the same time or they could happen in a sequence such as <alert>A and then B</alert>. How we calculate the theoretical probability of the event <em>A and B</em> (or <em>A and then B</em>) depends on whether the two events are independent or dependent.
	</p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>Independent and Dependent Events</title>
	<p>
		Two events <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are <alert>independent</alert> if the probability of <em>B</em> occurring is the same whether or not <em>A</em> occurs. If the probability of <em>B</em> is affected by the occurrence of <em>A</em>, then we say that the events are <alert>dependent</alert>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Coin flips and die rolls are common examples of independent events â flipping heads does not change the probability of flipping heads the next time, nor does rolling a six change the probability that the next roll will be a six.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another type of event is a selection event, such as randomly selecting or drawing items from a bag, etc. These are also independent if we <alert>draw with replacement</alert>. By replacing the item, we reset the probability back to what it was before we made the selection. Since the probability of each subsequent selection is the same as the first selection, the events are independent.
	</p>
	<p>
		If we draw <alert>without replacement</alert>, however, like selecting multiple people for a committee, we change the total number of possible outcomes, thereby changing the probability of subsequent selections. Therefore, if we draw without replacement, the events will be <alert>dependent</alert>.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Determine whether the following events are independent or dependent.
			<ol marker="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						Flipping a fair coin twice and getting heads both times.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Selecting a president and then a vice president at random from a pool of five equally qualified individuals.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The event that it will rain in Portland tomorrow and the event that it will rain in Beaverton tomorrow.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Wearing your lucky socks and getting an A on your exam. 
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
	</statement>
	<solution>
		<p>
			<ol marker="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						The probability of getting heads on the first flip is 0.5 or 50%. After flipping heads, the probability of getting heads on the second flip is still 0.5 or 50%. Since the probability of flipping heads on the second flip did not change because we flipped heads on the first flip, the events are <alert>independent</alert>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Since two different people will be put in the role of president and vice president, we are drawing without replacement and the events are therefore <alert>dependent</alert>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						If it is raining in Portland it is more likely that it will rain in Beaverton, so the events are <alert>dependent</alert>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Although there may some sort of placebo effect at play in terms of confidence and persistence, the socks you wear do not have a direct effect on how well you do on your exam, so these events are <alert>independent</alert>.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
	</solution>
	</example>
	
	<p>
		To calculate <q>and</q> probabilities we multiply, but we need to determine whether the events are independent or dependent. If they are independent, then we can multiply the individual probability of each event because one does not affect the other. If the events are dependent, then we need to multiply by the conditional probability based on what has previously happened. Here is a summary of this.
	</p>
	<assemblage>
	<title><q>And</q></title>
		<p>
			Probabilities If events A and B are independent, then <m>P(A \text{ and } B)=P(A)\cdot P(B)</m>
		</p>
		<p>
			If events A and B are dependent, then <m>P(A \text{ and } B)=P(A)\cdot P(B \text{ given } A)</m>
		</p>
	</assemblage>
	<p>
		The probability of <em>B given A</em> is called a <alert>conditional probability</alert> since it depends, or is conditional, on A occurring. We saw examples of conditional probability when we looked at contingency tables in the previous section.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Suppose you have a bag containing 6 red Legos, 4 green Legos, and 3 black Legos. We will make exactly two lego selections from the bag. What is the probability of selecting:
			<ol marker="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						two red Legos in a row if we put the first red Lego back in the bag?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						two red Legos in a row if we don't put the first Lego back in the bag?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						a red Lego and then a green Lego if we do not put the red Lego back in the bag?
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>

				The first thing we want to recognize is that this question is essentially asking for the probability of no citation and no citation and no citationâ¦. twenty times (one for each day you ride without buying a ticket). Since the outcomes are connected by an <q>and</q>, we know we will be multiplying the probabilities. In this case the the outcomes are independent (you are not more or less likely to get a citation if you already received a citation). Therefore,

<title><q>Or</q> Probabilities</title>
	<p>
		The event <alert>A or B</alert> refers to an event that includes the outcomes of <em>A</em> or <em>B</em> or <em>both</em>. We have seen the inclusive <q>or</q> both in terms of sets and logic, and in terms of contingency tables. The way we calculate the probability of <em>A or B</em> depends on whether the events have characteristics that are overlapping or disjoint.
	</p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>Overlapping or Disjoint Sets</title>
	<p>
		Recall that <alert>disjoint</alert> means the same thing as <alert>not overlapping</alert>. Just like we saw in the logic and sets chapter, the set diagram on the left shows overlapping sets and the set diagram on the right shows disjoint sets.
	</p>
	<sidebyside width="70%">
		<image source="images/probability/4_2/overlap.png">
		<shortdescription>Two set diagrams. The Venn diagram on the left shows two overlapping sets which have an intersecting area; The Venn diagram on the right shows two sets that are entirely separate, like cats and dogs.</shortdescription>
		</image>
	</sidebyside>
	<p>
		To apply this to probability, we will look at an example of events that have overlapping characteristics, such as color and shape.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			A prize machine is filled with 10 yellow erasers, 6 green erasers, 4 red pencil sharpeners, 8 yellow pencil sharpeners, and 5 red bouncy balls. Each prize is inside a plastic sphere, and the spheres are well mixed in the prize machine. Each game will get you just one prize. Determine the probability of
			<ol marker="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						getting a yellow prize.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						getting a red or yellow prize.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						getting a prize that is yellow or an eraser.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
	</statement>
	<solution>
		<p>
		<ol marker="a.">
			<li>
				<p>
					Since yellow is a single event, we just need to know how many prizes there are in total, and how many of the prizes are yellow. The yellow prizes include the 10 yellow erasers and the 8 yellow pencil sharpeners.
				</p>
				<p>
					<md>
					<mrow>P(\text{yellow})\amp=\frac{18}{33}</mrow>
					<mrow>\amp\approx 0.545 \text{ or } 54.5\%</mrow>
				</md>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					For a red or yellow prize, the set of red and the set of yellow do not overlap. They are disjoint sets, so we will add the probability of getting a red prize to the probability of getting a yellow prize.
				</p>
				<p>
					<md>
						<mrow>P(\text{red or yellow})\amp=P(\text{red})+P(\text{yellow})</mrow>
						<mrow>\amp=\frac{9}{33}+\frac{18}{33}</mrow>
						<mrow>\amp=\frac{27}{33}</mrow>
						<mrow>\amp\approx 0.818 \text{ or } 81.8\%</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					To find the probability of getting a prize that is yellow or an eraser, we need to be careful because these are overlapping sets. There are two ways to calculate this, and it is a lot like what we did with contingency tables. The first way is to add all the items separately, being careful not to double count.
				</p>
				<p>
					<md>
						<mrow>P(\text{yellow or eraser})\amp=P(\text{yellow eraser})+P(\text{yellow pencil sharpener})+P(\text{green eraser})</mrow>
						<mrow>\amp=\frac{10}{33}+\frac{8}{33}+\frac{6}{33}</mrow>
						<mrow>\amp=\frac{24}{33}</mrow>
						<mrow>\amp\approx 0.727 \text{ or } 72.7\%</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
				<p>
					The second way is to count the total of yellow items and the total of erasers, but the yellow erasers are in both sets, or the overlap. We would be counting them twice and so we subtract their joint probability.
				</p>
				<p>
					<md>
						<mrow>P(\text{yellow or eraser})\amp=P(\text{yellow})+P(\text{eraser})-P(\text{yellow and eraser})</mrow>
						<mrow>\amp=\frac{18}{33}+\frac{16}{33}-\frac{10}{33}</mrow>

		Here is a summary of how we found the <q>or</q> probabilities.
	</p>
	<assemblage>
	<title><q>Or</q> Probabilities</title>
		<p>
			If the sets are disjoint, <m>P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)</m>
		</p>
		<p>
			If the sets are overlapping, <m>P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) â P(A \text{ and } B)</m>
		</p>
	</assemblage>
	<p>
		We could also use the overlapping formula as a general formula, because in the case of disjoint sets, there is no intersection and <m>P(A \text{ and } B)=0</m>. Here is another example with overlapping events.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			What is the probability of rolling two fair dice and getting a pair or a sum of 6?
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
		<p>
			For complicated events it's a good idea to list all of the outcomes. Here we list them in a table. Looking at the table of outcomes, we see that there are 36 in total. Six outcomes that are pairs lie along the upper-to-lower diagonal that goes through <m>\highlight{3+3=6}</m>. There are 5 outcomes that add to 6 along the lower-to-upper diagonal line that also goes through <m>\highlight{3+3=6}</m>. That outcome is both a pair and a sum of 6, so the events are overlapping.

		<p>
			As in the last example, there are two ways to do this.
		</p>
		<p>
			If we add all of the pairs and sums of 6 without double counting, we get:
		</p>
		<p>
			<md>
				<mrow>P(\text{pair or sum of 6})\amp=P(\text{pair})+P(\text{sum of 6 that haven't been counted})</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp=\frac{6}{36}+\frac{4}{36}</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp=\frac{10}{36}</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp\approx 0.278 \text{ or } 27.8\%</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<p>
			To use the subtraction method, we need to add the probability of rolling a pair to the probability of rolling a sum of 6 and subtract the overlap. Thus we have:
		</p>
		<p>
			<md>
				<mrow>P(\text{pair or sum of 6})\amp=P(\text{pair})+P(\text{sum of 6})-P(\text{pair and a sum of 6})</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp=\frac{6}{36}+\frac{5}{36}-\frac{1}{36}</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp=\frac{10}{36}</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp\approx 0.278 \text{ or } 27.8\%</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>
		<p>
			Now that we have looked at empirical and theoretical probability, we will be able to use them for something very important in the next section â expected value.
