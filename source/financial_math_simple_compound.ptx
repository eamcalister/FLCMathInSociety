		Working with money is a very important skill for everyday life. While balancing a checkbook or calculating our monthly expenditures on espresso requires only arithmetic, when we start saving money, planning for retirement, or need a loan, we need more mathematics and tools. In this section we will calculate and compare simple and compound interest.

<subsection>
	<title>Simple Interest</title>
	<p>
		Calculating interest starts with the <alert>principal</alert>, <em>P</em>, or the beginning amount in your account. This is also called the <alert>present value</alert>. This could be a starting investment, or the starting amount of a loan. The <alert>interest rate</alert>, <em>I</em>, in its most simple form, is a percentage of the principal.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, if you borrowed $100 from a friend and agree to repay it with 5% interest, then the amount of interest you would pay would be 5% of 100. It is very important to remember to change the interest <alert>rate</alert>, r, of 5% into a decimal by moving the decimal two places to the left.
	</p>
	<p>
		<me>(0.05)\$100=\$5</me>
	</p>
	<p>
		The total amount you would repay is called the <alert>future value</alert> and would be $105, the original principal plus the interest.
	</p>
	<p>
		<me>\$100+\$5=\$105</me>
	</p>
	<p>
		Here are the formulas to represent the calculations we just did.
	</p>

			<dl width="narrow">
				<li>
					<title><m>I</m></title>
					<p>

					</p>
				</li>

		</p>
	</assemblage>

	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			A friend asks to borrow $300 and agrees to repay it in 30 days with 3% simple interest. How much interest will you earn?
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
		<p>
			<m>P = \$300</m>, the principal or present value
		</p>
		<p>
			<m>r = 0.03</m>, 3% rate
		</p>
		<p>
			Using the formula,
		</p>
				<p>
			<md>
				<mrow>I\amp=Pr</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp=\$300(0.03)</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp=\$9</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>
		<p>
			To calculate this in a spreadsheet, you would enter <cd>=300*0.03</cd> and get a result of $9. You will earn $9 in interest when your friend pays you back.
		</p>
		</solution>
	</example>
	<p>
		One-time simple interest is only common for extremely short-term or informal loans. For longer term loans or investments, it is common for interest to be paid on a daily, monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. In that case, interest would be earned regularly. Bonds are an example of this type of investment. Bonds are issued by the federal, state or local governments to cover their expenses.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Suppose your city is building a new park, and issues bonds to raise the money to build it. You buy a $1,000 bond that pays 5% simple interest annually and matures in 5 years. How much interest will you earn? What is the future value of the bond?
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
		<p>
			Each year, you would earn 5% interest so over the course of five years, you would earn:
		</p>
		<p>
			<me>\$1000(0.05)(5)=\$250</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			When the bond matures, you would receive back the $1,000 you originally paid and the $250 in interest, so we could also put that into a single calculation:
		</p>
		<p>
			<me>\$1000+\$1000(0.05)(5)=\$1250</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			Using a spreadsheet, you would enter <cd>=1000+1000*0.05</cd> and get a result of $1,250. The future value of the bond is $1,250.
		</p>
		</solution>

<subsection>
	<title>APR – Annual Percentage Rate</title>
	<p>
		Interest rates are usually stated as an annual percentage rate (APR) – the total interest that will be paid in the year. If not stated otherwise, assume that the interest rate is an annual rate or APR. If the interest is paid in smaller time increments, the APR will be divided by the number of time periods.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note: The Federal Truth in Lending Act requires that every consumer be given the true APR which includes the interest and any fees included.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, a 6% APR paid monthly, would be divided by 12, because you would get one twelfth of the rate per month, which is half a percent per month.
	</p>

	<p>
		<me>\frac{0.06}{12}=0.005</me>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		A 4% annual rate paid quarterly, would be divided by 4 to get 1% per quarter.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<me>\frac{0.04}{4}=0.01</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		Here is an example of a semi-annual rate.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Suppose you buy a $1,000 federal bond with a 4% annual simple interest rate, paid semi-annually, with a maturity in 4 years. How much interest will you earn? What will be the future value of the bond?
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
		<p>
			<m>P = \$1000</m>, the principal
		</p>
		<p>
			<m>r=\frac{0.04}{2}=0.02</m>, interest is being paid semi-annually (twice a year), so the 4% interest will be divided into two 2% payments.
		</p>
		<p>
			<m>t = 8</m>, 4 years compounded twice a year gives <m>t=4\cdot 2=8</m> half-years
		</p>
		<p>
			<md>
				<mrow>I\amp=PRT</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp=\$1000(0.02)(8)</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp=\$160</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>
		<p>
			You will earn $160 in interest over the four years. The future value of the loan is
		</p>
		<p>
			<md alignment="align">
				<mrow>A\amp=P+I</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp=\$1000+\$160</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp=\$1160</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<p>
			We could also use a spreadsheet to do this calculation and enter:
		</p>
		<p>
			<cd>=1000+1000*(0.04/2)*(4*2)</cd>
		</p>
		<p>
			which also gives $1,160. The future value of the bond is $1,160. Remember that spreadsheets don't interpret parentheses as multiplication. We need the asterisks as well as the parentheses.
		</p>
	</solution>
	</example>
</subsection>

<subsection>
	<title>Compound Interest</title>
	<p>
		In a standard bank account, any interest we earn is automatically added to our balance, and we earn interest on that interest. This reinvestment of interest is called <alert>compounding</alert>. We will develop the mathematical formula for compound interest and then show the equivalent spreadsheet function.
	</p>
	<p>
		Suppose that we deposit $1000 in a bank account offering 3% interest, compounded monthly. How will our money grow?
	</p>
	<p>
		The 3% interest is an annual percentage rate (APR) – the total interest to be paid during the year. Since interest is being paid monthly, each month, we will earn <m>\frac{0.03}{12}=0.0025</m> per month.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the first month,
	</p>

	<p>
		<md>
		<mrow>P\amp= \$1000</mrow>
		<mrow>r\amp=0.0025</mrow>
		<mrow>I\amp= \$1000 (0.0025)= \$2.50</mrow>
		<mrow>A\amp= \$1000 + \$2.50 = \$1002.50</mrow>
		</md>
	</p>
	<p>
		In the first month, we will earn $2.50 in interest, raising our account balance to $1002.50.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the second month,
	</p>
	<p>
		<md>
			<mrow>P\amp=\$1002.50</mrow>
			<mrow>I\amp=\$1002.50(0.0025)=\$2.51 \text{ (rounded)}</mrow>
			<mrow>A\amp=\$1002.50+\$2.51=\$1005.01</mrow>
		</md>
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice that in the second month we earned more interest than we did in the first month. This is because we earned interest not only on the original $1000 we deposited, but we also earned interest on the $2.50 of interest we earned the first month. This is the key advantage that compounding gives us.
	</p>
	<p>
		Calculating out a few more months in a table or a spreadsheet we have:

	<p>
		To find an equation to represent this, we will go through a few months to see the pattern:
	</p>
	<p>
		Initial Amount: <m>P=\$1000</m>
	</p>
	<p>
		<m>1^{\text{st}} \text{ Month } A=1.0025(\$1000)</m>
	</p>
	<p>
		<m>2^{\text{nd}} \text{ Month } A=1.0025(1.0025(\$1000))=1.0025^{2}(\$1000)</m>
	</p>
	<p>
		<m>3^{\text{rd}} \text{ Month } A=1.0025(1.0025^{2}(\$1000))=1.0025^{3}(\$1000)</m>
	</p>
	<p>
		<m>4^{\text{th}} \text{ Month } A=1.0025(1.0025^{3}(\$1000))=1.0025^{4}(\$1000)</m>
	</p>
	<p>
		Observing a pattern, we could conclude
	</p>
	<p>
		<m>n^{\text{th}} \text{ Month } A=1.0025^{n}(\$1000)</m>
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice that the $1000 in the equation was P, the starting amount. We found 1.0025 by adding one to the interest rate divided by 12, since we were compounding 12 times per year. Generalizing our result, we could write
	</p>

	<p>

<subsection>
<title>The Future Value Spreadsheet Formula</title>
	<p>
		The compound interest formula is built into spreadsheets and is called the future value formula.
	</p>
	<assemblage>
	<title>Future Value Spreadsheet Formula</title>
		<p>
			<cd>=FV(rate per period, number of periods, payment amount, present value)</cd>
		</p>
		<p>
			<dl width="narrow">
				<li>
					<title>rate per period</title>
					<p>
						is the interest rate per compounding period, <m>\sfrac{r}{n}</m>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<title>present value</title>
					<p>
						is the amount deposited or principal, <m>P</m>
					</p>
				</li>
			</dl>
		</p>
	</assemblage>
	<p>
		We will use the payment amount in a future section, for now that will be 0. There is also an optional input at the end to specify making payments at the beginning or end of the period, but we will not use it in this book.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now let's look at an example and calculate the compound interest using the spreadsheet and the mathematical formula.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			A certificate of deposit (CD) is a savings instrument that many banks offer. It usually gives a higher interest rate, but you cannot access your investment for a specified length of time. Suppose you deposit $3000 in a CD paying 6% APR, compounded monthly. How much will you have in the account after 20 years?
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
		<p>
			<m>P = \$3000</m>, the initial deposit
		</p>
		<p>
			<m>r = 0.06</m>, 6% annual rate
		</p>
		<p>
			<m>n = 12</m>, 12 months in 1 year
		</p>
		<p>
			<m>t = 20</m>, since we're looking for how much we'll have after 20 years
		</p>

		<p>
			To use a spreadsheet, we will use the formula like this
			<cd>=FV(rate per period, number of periods, payment amount, present value)</cd>
		</p>
		<p>
			<cd>=FV(0.06/12, 12*20, 0, 3000)</cd>
		</p>
		<p>
			and get a result of $9,930.61, rounded to the nearest cent.
		</p>
		<sidebyside width="50%">
			<image source="images/financial_math/2_2/future_value.png">
			<shortdescription>An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.</shortdescription>
			</image>
		</sidebyside>

		<p>
			Note that the output of the formula gives the answer with the opposite sign as the principal and payments. A negative number may be denoted with a negative sign or with the color red or parentheses. The signs may be used in accounting, but we will ignore them in this book.
		</p>
		<p>
			To use a formula, we are looking for the future value, so we use the formula solved for A:
		</p>
		<p>
			<md>
				<mrow>A\amp=3000\left(1+\frac{0.06}{12}\right)^{12\cdot20}</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp=\$9930.61</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>
		<p>
			To use a calculator, you would enter the formulas including parentheses around any inside operations. You would enter
		</p>
		<p>
			<cd>3000(1+(0.06/12))^(12*20)=$9930.61</cd>
		</p>
	</solution>
	</example>

</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>Comparing Simple and Compound Interest</title>
	<p>
		Let us compare the amount of money earned from compounding in the previous example against the amount you would earn from simple interest. From the table and graph below we can see that over a long period of time, compounding makes a large difference in the account balance. You may recognize this as the difference between linear growth and exponential growth.

<title>Finding the Principal, or Present Value</title>
	<p>
		When we know the amount of money we want to have in the future, we can use the formula that is solved for <em>P</em>. It requires a little algebra to divide both sides of the formula by the quantity that was multiplied by <em>P</em>. There is also a spreadsheet formula which we will introduce now, and then do an example using both methods.

	<title>Continuously Compounded Interest</title>
	<p>
		In many bank accounts your interest is compounded continuously, or at each moment in time. The number of times per year, n, is infinite. As n approaches infinity the compound interest formula changes to the continuously compounded interest formula.

	<title>Finding the Amount of Interest Earned and the Percentage</title>
	<p>
		In the previous example we also want to know how much interest was earned and what percentage of the final balance is from interest. The future value of the investment is $4,849.11. Now to figure out how much of that was interest, we need to subtract the amount initially deposited.
	</p>
	<example>
		<p>
			Continued: To find the total amount of interest earned, we subtract the principal from the total balance.
		</p>
		<p>
			<me>\$4849.11-\$4000=\$849.11</me>
		</p>
		<p>
			The spreadsheet calculation is
		</p>
		<p>
			<cd>=4849.11-4000</cd>
		</p>
		<p>
			which gives a result of $849.11. You would earn $849.11 in interest.
		</p>
		<p>
			To find the percentage that is interest, divide the amount of interest by the total amount.
		</p>
		<p>
			<me>\frac{\$849.11}{4849.11}=0.1751\text{ or } 17.5\%</me>
		</p>
		<p>
			The spreadsheet calculation is the same:
		</p>
		<p>
			<cd>=849.11/4849.11</cd>
		</p>
		<p>
			which is 0.1751 or 17.5%. This tells us that after 7 years, 17.5% of the account was earned as interest.

	<title>Effective Rate</title>
	<p>
		If you are shopping around for different investments, you might need to compare different rates that have different compounding periods. If the rate and period are different, it's hard to know which account will give the better result. There is a spreadsheet formula called <c>=EFFECT</c> which will allow us to compare accounts. This is also sometimes called the annual percentage yield, or APY.
	</p>
	<assemblage>
		<title>Effective Rate Formula</title>
		<p>
			<cd>=EFFECT(stated rate, number of compounding periods)</cd>
		</p>
		<p>

	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			You are comparing an account that pays 5.25% APR compounded monthly, with an account that pays 5% APR compounded daily. Which account will earn you more interest?
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
		<p>
			It is hard to tell whether the higher interest rate will be better or the higher compounding rate in this case. We will find the effective rate of both accounts.
		</p>

		<p>
			For the 5.25% APR account compounded monthly:
		</p>
	
		<sidebyside valign="middle" widths="40% 54%" margins="0%">
			<stack>
				<p>

			<shortdescription>An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.</shortdescription>
			</image>
		</sidebyside>
		
		<p>
			Now we can compare the effective rates of 5.38% and 5.13% and see that the account with the higher interest rate will earn more interest in this case. This is not always true, so we will show another example.
		</p>
		</solution>
