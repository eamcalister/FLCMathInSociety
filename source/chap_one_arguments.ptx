<subsection>
<title>Logical Arguments</title>
	<p>
	 A <alert>logical argument</alert> is a claim that a set of <alert>premises</alert> support a <alert>conclusion</alert>. It is possible for a logical argument to have one or many premises, but there must be one conclusion. In this section we will look at types of arguments and how to determine the strength, validity and/or soundness of each type. There are two types of arguments we will explore in this section: <alert>inductive</alert> and <alert>deductive</alert> arguments.
	</p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>Inductive and Deductive Arguments</title>

<p>
	To better understand the difference between inductive and deductive arguments, let's start by looking at a couple of examples.
</p>
	<example>
		<p>
			Consider the following argument:
		</p>
		<p>
			When I went to the store last week, I forgot my wallet, and I forgot it again when I went back today. I always forget my wallet when I go to the store.
		</p>
		<p>
			Before we analyze an argument, it is helpful to precisely state its premises and its conclusion. Most arguments you encounter in the real world won't be stated in a precise <q>premise, premise, conclusion</q> form. Sometimes the conclusion will be stated before the premises, or the premises will be hidden within a bunch of rhetoric.
		</p>
		<p>
			To begin our analysis of this first argument, let's first rewrite it in a more precise <q>premise, premise, conclusion</q> form.
		</p>
		<p>
			Premise: I forgot my wallet when I went to the store last week. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Premise: I forgot my wallet when I went to the store today. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Conclusion: I always forget my wallet when I go to the store. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Notice that both premises make a claim about a <alert>specific</alert> instance – the specific instance last week when I forgot my wallet, and the specific instance today when I forgot my wallet. The conclusion, on the other hand, states what we can expect to happen more generally.
		</p>
	</example>
	<p>
		Now let's consider a different argument:
	</p>
	<example>
		<p>
			Henry must know CPR because he is a nurse and all nurses know CPR.
		</p>
		<p>
			Just as we did for the last example, let's rewrite the argument in its <q>premise, premise, conclusion</q> form:
		</p>
		<p>
			Premise: All nurses know CPR.
		</p>
		<p>
			Premise: Henry is a nurse.
		</p>
		<p>
			Conclusion: Henry knows CPR.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unlike the first argument where the premises were specific and the conclusion was general, this argument's first premise is a general statement and the conclusion is specific. We can determine whether an argument is inductive or deductive by looking at which part of the argument is general and which is specific. In the first example, the premises were specific and the conclusion was more general. This is an example of an <alert>inductive</alert> argument. In the second example, it was the premises that were more general and the conclusion that was specific. This is an example of a <alert>deductive</alert> argument. 
		</p>
	</example>

	<p>
		In general, an <alert>inductive argument</alert> uses a collection of <em>specific</em> examples (i.e. data) as its premises and uses them to propose a <em>general</em> conclusion. This is shown in the image on the left below, where the argument moves from the narrow specific premises at the bottom up to the wide general conclusion at the top. A <alert>deductive argument</alert> uses a collection of <em>general statements</em> (i.e. definitions) as its premises and uses them to propose a <em>specific conclusion</em>. This is shown in the image to the right below, where the argument moves from the wide general premises at the bottom to the narrow specific conclusion at the top.

	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Rewrite the following arguments in a precise “premise, premise, conclusion” form, and determine if the argument is inductive or deductive.
			<ol marker="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						A number is prime if it is only divisible by itself and one. Since the number 13 is only divisible by itself and one, 13 must be prime. 
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Juan's dog Goober is having puppies. All three of Goober's previous litters have had 5 puppies so Goober is bound to have 5 puppies in this litter as well. 
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
		<p>
			<ol marker="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						Premise: If a number is only divisible by itself and one, the number is prime. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Premise: The number 13 is only divisible by itself and one.
					</p>
					<p>
						Conclusion: 13 is prime.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since the premises are general definitions and properties of numbers and the conclusion is a specific statement about the number 13, the argument is <alert>deductive</alert>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Premise: Goober is having puppies.
					</p>
					<p>
						Premise: Goober's last three litters had 5 puppies.
					</p>
					<p>
						Conclusion: Goober's current litter will have 5 puppies.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is an example of an <alert>inductive argument</alert> since it uses specific experiences/instances as its premises, and its conclusion is a general expectation based on those specific experiences.

<subsection>
	<title>Evaluating Arguments</title>
	<p>
		Inductive arguments cannot be proven. The best we can do is evaluate the <alert>strength</alert> of the argument based on the evidence it provides.
	</p> 
	<p>
		A strong inductive argument is one that is well supported by its premises, while a weak inductive argument is one whose premises do a poor job of supporting the conclusion. The strength of an inductive argument is subjective, because where one person sees a strong argument, another may see a weak argument. Additionally, the strength and truth of an argument are not necessarily related; it is possible to have a weak argument that is true, and a strong argument that is false.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Determine the strength of the inductive argument. 
		</p>
		<p>
			James Franco, Jodie Foster, Jennifer Lawrence, and Jack Nicholson have all won Academy Awards for acting. Actors whose names start with J are bound to win an Academy Award.
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				The inductive argument provides a number of specific cases as evidence for the conclusion. However, we would not be surprised if a J-named actor <em>did not</em> win an Academy Award, so the argument is weak.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<p>
		Deductive arguments, on the other hand, can be proven and their validity and soundness can be evaluated. The <alert>validity of the argument</alert> is based on whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises, while the <alert>soundness of the argument</alert> is based on whether or not the premises are true. An argument cannot be sound if it is not valid, even if the premises seem reasonable. 
	</p>

</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>Evaluating Deductive Arguments Using Sets</title>
	<p>
		One way to determine whether a deductive argument is valid is to illustrate the premises of the argument using sets and see if the conclusion logically follows if we assume the premises to be true.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Use a set diagram to determine whether the argument is valid. If the argument is valid, determine if it is also sound.
			<ol marker="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						<q>All cats are mammals and a tiger is a cat, so a tiger is a mammal.</q>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<q>All water bottles are plastic. This is a water bottle, so it must be plastic.</q> 
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<q>All firefighters know CPR. Jill knows CPR, so Jill must be a firefighter.</q>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<q>None of my friends like dancing. Kai doesn't like dancing. Therefore, Kai is my friend.</q>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<q>Some young adults make minimum wage and Tara is a young adult. Therefore, Tara makes minimum wage.</q>
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
		<p>
			<ol marker="a.">
				<li>
					<p>
						First let's write the argument in its <q>premise, premise, conclusion</q> form. For the problems we will be looking at, you will want to write the first premise as a <alert>qualified proposition</alert> (some, none, all) since this will form the basic structure of our diagram.
					</p>
					<p>
						Premise: All cats are mammals. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Premise: A tiger is a cat. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Conclusion: A tiger is a mammal.
					</p>
					<p>
						From the first premise we know that all cats lie inside the set of mammals (cats are a subset of mammals). From the second premise, we know that tigers lie inside the set of cats (marked with an X), and therefore also lie within the set of mammals.
					</p>
					<sidebyside width="65%">
					<image source="images/language_logic_rules/1_3/eval_arg1.png">
					<shortdescription>A set diagram with the circle for the set of cats contained within the set of mammals. Both are in the universal set rectangle; There is an arrow for tigers pointing to the inside of the cats circle</shortdescription>
					</image>
					</sidebyside>
					<p>
						This argument is valid because we were able to show that the conclusion follows logically from the premises. The argument is also sound since the premises <q>all cats are mammals</q> and <q>a tiger is a cat</q> are true.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						From the first premise we know that all water bottles lie inside the set of plastic items (water bottles are a subset of plastic). From the second premise, we know that this particular water bottle must lie within the plastic items set.
					</p>
					<sidebyside width="65%">
					<image source="images/language_logic_rules/1_3/eval_arg2.png">
					<shortdescription>A set diagram with the circle for the set of water bottles contained within the set of plastic.  Both are in the universal set rectangle; There is an arrow for this water bottle pointing to the inside of the water bottle circle</shortdescription>
					</image>
					</sidebyside>
					<p>
						This argument is valid because we were able to show that the conclusion follows logically from the premises. But the argument is not sound because the premise that all water bottles are plastic is not true. There are many versions of glass and metal bottles that are evidence that the first premise is not true. This argument is valid but not sound.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						From the first premise we know that all firefighters lie inside the set of those who know CPR (firefighters are a subset of people who know CPR). From the second premise, we know that Jill is a member of the set of those who know CPR, but we do not have enough information to know whether she is also a member of set of firefighters.
					</p>
					<sidebyside width="65%">
					<image source="images/language_logic_rules/1_3/eval_arg3.png">
					<shortdescription>A set diagram with the circle for the set of firefighters contained within the set of those who know CPR. Both are in the universal set rectangle; There is a question mark inside the firefighter circle and in the larger know CPR region because we don't know which region Jill is in</shortdescription>
					</image>
					</sidebyside>
					<p>
						Since we cannot determine which group Jill must be a part of, the argument is invalid. The statement that Jill is a firefighter does not follow logically from the premises that <q>all firefighters know CPR</q> and that <q>Jill knows CPR</q>. Since the argument is not valid, it cannot be sound.
					</p>

				<li>
					<sidebyside width="50%">
					<image source="images/language_logic_rules/1_3/eval_arg4.png">
					<shortdescription>A set diagram with 2 disjoint sets, people who like to dance and my friends; Both circles are in the universal set rectangle; There is a question mark in the  my friends circle and in the region outside the circles because we don't know where Kai goes.</shortdescription>
					</image>
					</sidebyside>
					<p>
						Because it said <q>none</q> we draw disjoint sets – one set for my friends and a second set for people who like to dance. The second premise tells us that Kai doesn't like to dance so they're not in the set of people who like to dance. However, we can't put Kai in the set of my friends either. They could be my friend, or someone I don't know who happens to not like dancing. Therefore, the conclusion is <alert>not valid</alert>. And therefore, the arguement is also <alert>not sound</alert>.

					</image>
					</sidebyside>
					<p>
						Because it said <q>some</q> we draw overlapping sets. The second premise tells us to put Tara in the set of young adults, but it doesn't tell us if she makes minimum wage or not. So, like the previous example we cannot determine which region she is in. She could make minimum wage, or she could also make more. Therefore, the conclusion is <alert>not valid</alert> and therefore, <alert>not sound</alert>.

			Since all cats are scared of vacuum cleaners and Max is a cat, Max must be scared of vacuum cleaners.

			<p>
				Premise: Max is a cat.

			<p>
				Conclusion: Max must be scared of vacuum cleaners.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is a deductive argument. It is valid. However, it is not sound because the premise all cats are afraid of vacuum cleaners is false. While many cats are afraid of vacuum cleaners not ALL cats are afraid. There are many videos of cats riding electronic vacuum cleaners.

			</p>
			<p>
				Conclusion: Women and nonbinary people make less than men.

			<p>
				This is an inductive argument. Kiran did not gather a large diverse sample because they only asked their friends. Therefore, their data has sampling bias. This makes their argument weak.

			<p>
				This argument is deductive. The argument is valid because Laura is outside of the set of self-absorbed people, so she must also be outside of this set of people on this reality show.

		Conclusion: Claudia missed more than 25% of class time.
	</p>
	</statement>
	<solution>
