		In the next chapter we will study different types of data at length. In order to discuss probability we must first introduce a certain type of data called <term>categorical data</term>. This is data that allows us to classify objects into categories. A <term xml:id="categorical_variable_def">categorical variable</term> is a way of describing an object in terms of categorical data. Here are a few examples:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					<em>Variable:</em> Type of phone owned by a person.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Possible Values:</em> Iphone, Android
				</p>
				<p>
					This variable classifies a person by the type of phone they own.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<em>Variable:</em> Type of motor in a car.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Possible Values:</em> Gasoline, Diesel, Electric
				</p>
				<p>
					This variable classifies a car by the type of motor that propels it.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<em>Variable:</em> (Primary) position of a major league baseball player.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Possible Values:</em> Pitcher, Catcher, 1st Base, 2nd Base, Shortstop, 3rd Base, Right Field, Center Field, Left, Field, Designated Hitter
				</p>
				<p>
					This variable classifies a baseball player by their position. We have to indicate that this is their primary position because a player may play more than one position, but there is one that they play most.

<title>Contingency Tables</title>
	<p>
		A <alert>contingency table</alert> summarizes all the possible combinations for two categorical variables. Each value in the table represents the number of times a particular combination of outcomes occurs. For example, suppose we randomly select 250 households from the greater Portland area and ask whether they have a cat and whether they have a dog. In this case, <q>have a cat</q> and <q>have a dog</q> are the two variables, and each variable has two categories: Yes and No. To create the contingency table, we make columns for the categories of one variable, and rows for the categories of the other variable. We also add a row and column for the subtotals of each category. Each cell of the resulting table contains the number of outcomes having the characteristics of the intersecting row and column categories. For our dog and cat example, the table would look like this: 
	</p>
		<tabular row-headers="yes" halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
			<row header="yes">
				<cell></cell>
				<cell>Dog</cell>
				<cell>No Dog</cell>
				<cell>Total</cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>Cat</cell>
				<cell><em>Yes Cat and Yes Dog</em></cell>
				<cell><em>Yes Cat and No Dog</em></cell>
				<cell><em>Yes Cat Total</em></cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>No Cat</cell>
				<cell><em>No Cat and Yes Dog</em></cell>
				<cell><em>No Cat and No Dog</em></cell>
				<cell><em>No Cat Total</em></cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>Total</cell>
				<cell><em>Yes Dog Total</em></cell>
				<cell><em>No Dog Total</em></cell>
				<cell><em>Grand total</em></cell>
			</row>
		</tabular>
	<p>
		Suppose that of the 250 households surveyed, 180 said they have a cat, 95 said they have a dog, and 52 said they have both a cat and a dog. We can use this information to fill in the cells of the table.
	</p>
		<tabular row-headers="yes" halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
			<row header="yes">
				<cell></cell>
				<cell>Dog</cell>
				<cell>No Dog</cell>
				<cell>Total</cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>Cat</cell>
				<cell>52</cell>
				<cell></cell>
				<cell>180</cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>No Cat</cell>
				<cell></cell>
				<cell></cell>
				<cell></cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>Total</cell>
				<cell>95</cell>
				<cell></cell>
				<cell>250</cell>
			</row>
		</tabular>
	<p>
		The first cell we can fill in is the <alert>grand total</alert>, which is the total number of subjects in the study. In this case, there are 250 households participating in the survey. The next two cells we can fill in are the total number of households that have a cat, 180, and the total number of households that have a dog, 95. The final cell we can fill in from the given information is the intersection of the having a dog column and a having a cat row, which is 52 households.
	</p>

	<p>
		Since each row and column must sum to their totals, we can use subtraction to find the missing numbers as shown below.
	</p>
		<tabular row-headers="yes" halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
			<row header="yes">
				<cell></cell>
				<cell>Dog</cell>
				<cell>No Dog</cell>
				<cell>Total</cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>Cat</cell>
				<cell>52</cell>
				<cell><m>180-52=128</m></cell>
				<cell>180</cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>No Cat</cell>
				<cell><m>95-52=43</m></cell>
				<cell><line><m>155-128=27</m></line><line>or</line><line><m>70-43=27</m></line></cell>
				<cell><m>250-180=70</m></cell>

				<cell>Total</cell>
				<cell>95</cell>
				<cell><m>250-95=155</m></cell>
				<cell>250</cell>
			</row>
		</tabular>
	<p>
		Now that we have our contingency table completed, notice that the numbers in the central four cells add to the grand total as shown in the table on the left. The total row and the total column also add to the grand total as shown in the right table.

<title>Contingency Tables and Venn Diagrams
</title>

	<p>
		If the subtractions we just did seem familiar, they should! This is very similar to what we did for reporting data with a Venn diagram. The Venn diagram for this data is shown below. We also subtracted the intersection from the total of the cat and dog owners to find numbers in the crescent regions.
	</p>

	<p>
		Notice that the numbers in the four regions of the Venn diagram are the same as the four cells in the center of the contingency table and add to the grand total.

	<title><q>And</q> Statements</title>
	<p>
		Now we can use the contingency table <!--or the Venn diagram--> to determine the percentage of households that meet certain conditions. For instance, what percent of those surveyed own a cat <alert>and</alert> do not own a dog? <!--In the Venn diagram, this is 128 households in the cat only region.-->
	</p>

	<p>
		In the contingency table we see the 128 households at the intersection of the row of households who own a cat and the column of households who do not own a dog. As a percentage, the total number of households surveyed, is <m>\frac{128}{250}=0.512</m> or 51.2% that have a cat and no dog.
	</p>
		<tabular row-headers="yes" halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">

<subsection>
	<title><q>Or</q> Statements</title>
	<p>
		How about the percentage of households surveyed that have a cat <alert>or</alert> a dog? <!--We know from Venn diagrams that the inclusive <em>or</em> includes the number of households who own a cat only, a dog only, and both a cat and a dog, or <m>128+52+43=223</m> households. As a percentage of the total surveyed, we get <m>\frac{223}{250}=0.892</m> or 89.2% of households in the sample have a dog <alert>or</alert> a cat (or both).
	</p>-->
	<!--p-->
		We can get the answer from the contingency table. By adding the cells for households who have a cat and not a dog, a dog and not a cat, and the households that have both a cat and a dog. This gives us 223 households.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is another way to calculate an <em>or</em> statements from a contingency table. We could add the row and column totals for having a cat and having a dog, but then we have counted the 52 households in the intersection twice. We can subtract that number to get <m>180+95-52=223</m> households with a dog or a cat, which we know is 89.2% of those surveyed.
	</p>
		<tabular row-headers="yes" halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">

			</row>
		</tabular>
</subsection>

<subsection>
	<title>Conditional Statements</title>

	<p>
		Another question we can answer using a contingency table is what percentage of dog owning households also own a cat? In this case the group that we are interested in isn't every household surveyed (the grand total), but just those households that own a dog.
	</p>
		<tabular row-headers="yes" halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
			<row header="yes">
				<cell></cell>
				<cell><c>Dog</c></cell>
				<cell>No Dog</cell>
				<cell>Total</cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>Cat</cell>
				<cell><c>52</c></cell>
				<cell>128</cell>
				<cell>180</cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>No Cat</cell>
				<cell><c>43</c></cell>
				<cell>27</cell>
				<cell>70</cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>Total</cell>
				<cell><c>95</c></cell>
				<cell>155</cell>
				<cell>250</cell>
			</row>
		</tabular>
	<p>
		We call this a <alert>conditional</alert> statement because we are only considering the households with a certain condition. If we focus on the column representing the households that own a dog, we see that there is a total of 95 households with a dog, and that 52 of those 95 households also have a cat. Therefore, <m>\frac{52}{95} \approx 0.547</m> or approximately 54.7% of the households with a dog also have a cat. Another way to phrase this conditional statement is, <q>What percent of households have a cat <alert>given</alert> they have a dog.</q> You will see the word given quite a bit in this chapter and that makes the denominator change. <!--It is also possible to find this conditional percentage using the Venn diagram by taking the number in the intersection and dividing it by the total in the whole dog circle.--> 
	</p>

<subsection>
<title>Contingency Tables with More Than Two Categories</title>
	<!--p>
		When there are only two categories for each variable, like yes/no questions, Venn diagrams and contingency tables provide basically the same information and can be used interchangeably. A Venn diagram works well for yes/no variables since a subject is either inside the circle (has the characteristic) or outside the circle (does not have the characteristic). If we have more than two possibilities for any of the variables, though, we cannot use a Venn diagram. We can use a contingency table, though. Here is an example where one variable has four categories and the other has three categories.
	</p-->

<example>
	<statement>
	<p>
		910 randomly sampled registered voters from Tampa, FL were asked if they thought workers who have illegally entered the US should (i) be allowed to keep their jobs and apply for US citizenship, (ii) be allowed to keep their jobs as temporary guest workers but not be allowed to apply for US citizenship, or (iii) lose their jobs and have to leave the country. Not sure was also an option (iv). The results of the survey by political ideology are shown below<fn>SurveyUSA, <url href="http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=60d6fa81-2698-4c51-a5f8-714f40976df2" visual="surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=60d6fa81-2698-4c51-a5f8-714f40976df2">News Poll #18927</url>, data collected Jan 27-29, 2012.

					To answer this question, we find the conservative column and look to the bottom cell for the total number of conservative voters and divide that by the total number of voters surveyed.

					For this question we find the apply for citizenship row, look across to find the total, and divide this by the total number of voters surveyed. We get <m>\frac{278}{910} \approx 0.305</m> or approximately 31% of these voters are in favor of the citizenship option.

				<p>
					For this question we are looking for the cell that is the intersection of those who identify as conservative and those who are in favor of the citizen option.

				In terms of the individual cells, the number of voters who have the specified characteristics is the sum <m>179+126+101+28+45+1=480</m>, which we can divide by the total number of voters surveyed to get the percent. So, we have <m>\frac{480}{910} \approx 0.527</m> or approximately 53% of the voters identify as liberal or are in favor of the leave the country option. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Another way to calculate this is to add the total number who identify as liberal (175 voters) and the total number who are in favor of the leave the country option (350 voters), then subtract the double counted cell (45 voters) who are liberal and in favor of the leave the country option: <m>175+350-45=480</m>

				<p>
					As we saw before, these are conditional statements. For the first part of this question, we want to focus just on those voters who identify as conservatives, and from among that group determine the percent in favor of the citizenship option. We calculate that <m>\frac{57}{372} \approx 0.153</m> or approximately 15% of conservative voters are in favor of the citizenship option.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the second part, we want to focus on just those voters who identify as moderate, and from among that group determine the percent in favor of the citizenship option. Then we have <m>\frac{120}{363} \approx 0.33</m> or approximately 33% of moderate voters are in favor of the citizen option.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, we want to focus on just those voters who identify as liberal, and from among that group determine the percent in favor of the citizenship option. We calculate <m>\frac{101}{175} \approx 0.58</m> or approximately 58% of liberal voters are in favor of the citizenship option. Looking at these three percentages, it is clear that support of the citizenship option <alert>depends</alert> on political ideology. If support of the citizenship option were the same across political ideologies, then we would say that favoring the citizenship option and political ideology were <alert>independent</alert> of each other.

<title>Empirical Probability</title>
	<p>
		If our sample is representative of the population, then we can also interpret a percentage we calculate from a contingency table as a <alert>probability</alert>, or the likelihood that something will happen. Since a contingency table is constructed from data collected through sampling or an experiment, we call it an <alert>empirical</alert> or <alert>experimental</alert> probability. This is different from a <alert>theoretical</alert> probability which we will look at in the next section.

<title>Finding Empirical Probabilities with a Contingency Table</title>
<p>
	Suppose that 60% of students in our class have a summer birthday (June, July, or August). Now suppose everyone's name and birth month are written on slips of paper and thrown into a bag. If we pull a slip of paper out of the bag at random, what is the probability that the selected student has a summer birthday? If you think there should be a 60% chance, you are right! The relative frequency of the characteristic of interest will be equal to its empirical probability. To write this as a probability statement, it would look like
</p>
<p>
	<md>
		<mrow>\text{P(summer birthday)}=60\%</mrow>
	</md>
</p>

<p>
	Probability is a function named <em>P</em>, and the function is applied to what follows in the parentheses. Let's look at another example where we write probability statements and find empirical probabilities.
</p>

<example>
	<statement>
	<p>

					The probability <m>P(\text{speeding ticket given red car})</m> is a conditional probability as we have seen before since it is conditional on the given characteristic occurring. In this problem, the given characteristic is owning a red car, so we isolate our attention to just the row of 150 red car owners and see how many have had a speeding ticket in the last year. Looking at the table, we see that there were 15 red car owners who had a speeding ticket in the last year, so we calculate:
				</p>
				<p>
					<md>
					<mrow>P(\text{speeding ticket given red car})=\frac{15}{150} = 0.10\text{ or } 10\%</mrow>

				<p>
					This question is also asking for a conditional probability, <m>P(\text{red car given speeding ticket})</m>, but it is phrased more like we would say it. In this case the given characteristic is that the person has received a speeding ticket, so we will isolate our attention to just the speeding ticket column. Among the 60 people who had a speeding ticket in the last year, we see that 15 also drove a red car. Now we can calculate the probability:
				</p>
				<p>
					<md>
					<mrow>P(\text{red car given speeding ticket})=\frac{15}{60} = 0.25\text{ or }25\%</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
				<p>
					Notice that compared with part e, when we change the conditional characteristic, we change the denominator of the fraction.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					In part b, we determined that there was a 9% chance of randomly selecting a participant who had received a speeding ticket in the last year. However, in part e we found that there was a 25% chance of receiving a ticket in the last year if the person had a red car. This seems to suggest that there is a higher likelihood of getting a speeding ticket if you own a red car. This means that getting a speeding ticket is <term>dependent</term> on whether the person drives a red car, since that increases the probability of getting a ticket. We cannot say, however, whether driving a red car makes you speed or whether people who tend to drive faster buy red cars.
