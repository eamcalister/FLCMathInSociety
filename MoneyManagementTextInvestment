Learning objectives are fine


You can save your money in a safe or a vault (or worse, under the mattress!), but that money does not grow. It would be hard to save enough for retirement that way. What can be done to increase the value of the money you already have?

The answer is to invest it. Use the money that you have to earn more money back. For instance, as we saw in Methods of Savings, you can save it in a bank. Or, to reach loftier goals, invest in something more likely to grow, such as stocks.

A great example of this is Apple stock. Anyone who bought stock in Apple Inc. (formerly Apple Computer, Inc.) in 1997 and held onto the shares earned a lot of money. To be more specific, $100 worth of Apple shares bought in 1980, when it was first sold to the public, was valued at $67,564 in 2019, or 676 times more! Perhaps you have heard a story like that, of an investment opportunity taken that paid off, or the story of an investment opportunity missed. But such stories are the exceptions.

In this section, weâ€™ll investigate bonds, stocks, and mutual funds and their comparative strengths and weaknesses. We close the section with a discussion of retirement savings accounts.
