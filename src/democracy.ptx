			Dr. Chichilnisky applied algebraic topology to voting theory and the theory of social choice. She accounted for not only the order of voting preference but also the intensity of preference among the alternatives (Chichilnisky, 1980). Due to her innovative work in this area, continuous social choice has become an international subdiscipline.

			More recently, Dr. Chichilnisky combined her research in math and economics to focus on climate change. Dr. Chichilnisky acted as the lead author on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which received the 2007 Nobel Prize for its work in deciding world policy with respect to climate change, and she worked extensively on the Kyoto Protocol, creating and designing the carbon market that became international law in 2005 (Siegle, 2010).
