		Portland Community College serves nearly 73,000 full-time and part-time students in the greater Portland area at four main campuses (SE, Cascade, Sylvania, and RC). Student Affairs would like to know how students get to campus. They randomly select 250 students from each of the four main campus and ask them how they got to classes on campus. The following are the results of their survey:

Participants were randomly and equally assigned to use the app (Rewire) or receive services as usual from the Department of Youth Services. Participants were assessed to determine a baseline for substance use at the beginning of the study, and were asked to complete follow up assessments after 1 and 3 months. Assessments consisted of online surveys asking about substance use, emotion regulation, family demographics, and mindfulness practices. Urine samples were collected at each interview to verify self-reported substance use.

		Suppose you buy a new car whose advertised gas mileage is 35 mpg (miles per gallon). After driving the car for several months, you find that you are getting only 30.4 mpg. You phone the manufacturer and learn that the standard deviation for that model is 1.35 mpg.
	</p>
	<p>
		<ol label="a.">
			<li>
				<p>
					Find the z-score for the gas mileage of your car.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Does it appear that your car is getting unusually low gas mileage? Explain your answer using your z-score.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	</statement>
	<solution>
		<p>
		<ol label="a.">
			<li>
				<p>
					<m>z=\frac{(30.4-35)}{1.35}=\frac{-4.6}{1.35} \approx -3.41</m>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					30.4 mpg is 3.41 standard deviations below the mean so the car is getting unusually low gas mileage.

		This data is a sample of the average number of minutes per week that a driver is delayed by road congestion in 13 cities:
	</p>
	<p>
		66, 55, 53, 50, 36, 45, 34, 43, 52, 40, 76, 45, 63
