<title>Voting Rights</title>
	<p>
		Now that we have studied how to apportion the number of representatives for each state, along with a brief history of the U.S. government, we want to look at how representatives and other public officials are elected. There are also many other situations where a group consensus is needed, and some type of voting occurs. You may be most familiar with systems where you get one vote and the candidate with the most votes wins. However, there are many other ways of determining a winner. We will look at several voting methods in this section.
	</p>
	<p>
		For an election using any of these methods to be fair, each person must have an equal right to vote and an equal ability to exercise that right. The <alert>Voting Rights Act of 1965</alert> prohibited any election practice that denies the right to vote based on race, but key portions of the law have been invalidated since then. <alert>Voter suppression</alert> continues today in different forms such as purging voter rolls, eliminating polling places and voter identification laws, which can also affect transgender people.
	</p>
	<p>
		<alert>The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act</alert> was passed in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2019 to restore elements of the Voting Rights Act and make it possible to enforce the law. It has not been taken up in the Senate, though. Follow this link if you would like to read a more detailed timeline of voting rights<fn><url href="https://www.aclu.org/voting-rights-act-major-dates-history" visual="aclu.org/voting-rights-act-major-dates-history"/></fn>.

<subsection>
	<title>Ranked Choice Ballots</title>
	
	<p>
		To use some of the methods we are going to study, we need to know more than just each person's first choice. We also need to know their 2nd and 3rd choices, and so on. A ballot where each person ranks all of the choices in order of their preference is called a <alert>ranked choice ballot</alert>.

	<title>Preference Schedule</title>
	<p>
		To simplify this data, we create a <alert>preference schedule</alert> which combines all the people who voted with the exact same ranking. For example, Tasha, Lupe, and Helena, all voted in the same way, HAO. So, we will list that combination once, with the number 3 at the top of that column. Three students also voted for AHO, and OHA. One student voted for the ranking AOH. Below is the preference schedule.
	</p>
	<sidebyside valign="middle" widths="47% 47%" margins="0%">
	<tabular halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">

	<p>
		Notice that by totaling the vote counts across the top of the preference schedule we can see the total number of votes cast: <m>1+3+3+3 = 10</m> total votes.

<subsection>
	<title>Plurality Method</title>
	<p>
		The voting method you may be most familiar with in the United States is the <alert>plurality method</alert>. In the plurality method, the candidate with the most first-choice votes is declared the winner.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is a difference between a <alert>majority</alert> and a plurality. For a majority, a candidate must have over 50% of the votes. There are some states that require a majority in order to win an election. In more cases, though, only a plurality is required, which means having more votes than any other candidate. If a tie occurs without using ranked choice voting, then a new run-off election would be required.
	</p>
	<example xml:id="example_2">
		<statement>
		<p>
			In our election from above, we had this preference table:
		</p>
		<sidebyside>
		<tabular halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
			<row header="no">
				<cell>Number of voters</cell>
				<cell>1</cell>
				<cell>3</cell>
				<cell>3</cell>
				<cell>3</cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>1st choice</cell>
				<cell>A</cell>
				<cell>A</cell>
				<cell>O</cell>
				<cell>H</cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>2nd choice</cell>
				<cell>O</cell>
				<cell>H</cell>
				<cell>H</cell>
				<cell>A</cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>3rd choice</cell>
				<cell>H</cell>
				<cell>O</cell>
				<cell>A</cell>
				<cell>O</cell>
			</row>
		</tabular>
		</sidebyside>
		<p>
			For the plurality method, we only look at the 1st choice row. Totaling them up:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						Ana: <m>1+3 = 4</m> votes
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Omar: <m>3</m> votes
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Helena: <m>3</m> votes
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Ana is the winner using the plurality voting method.
		</p>
		<p>
			Notice that Ana won with 4 out of 10 votes, or 40% of the votes, which is a plurality of the votes, but not a majority.
		</p>
		</statement>
	</example>
</subsection>

<subsection>
	<title>How Many Votes are Needed to Win?</title>
	<p>
		If we know how many voters there are, we can calculate the minimum number of votes needed for a majority win.
	</p>
	<p>
		Continuing <xref ref="example_2"></xref> from above, there are 10 voters, so we divide that by 2 or multiply by 0.5 to find 50%. Then we round up to the next whole number to get just over 50%.
	</p>
	<p>
		<m>10 \div 2=5</m>. Then we round up to 6 votes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Exactly half of the votes would be a tie, so we round up to the next whole number. A candidate would need 6 out of 10 votes to win a majority. If there was an odd number of voters we would divide by 2 and get a decimal. Let's say there were 13 voters:
	</p>
	<p>
		<m>13 \div 2=6.5</m>. Then we round up to 7 votes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Then we round up to the next whole number, which is 7 votes. A candidate can win a plurality with fewer votes than the majority, as long as they have more than any other candidate.
	</p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
	<title>Insincere Voting</title>
	<p>
		In a system with only two major political parties like the United States, it can be nearly impossible for third-party candidates to break through. You may feel like you would be wasting your vote if you voted for a third-party candidate. Consider this example.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Here is a two-party election with preferences shown below. It is a close race, but candidate B would win.
		</p>
		<sidebyside>
		<tabular halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
			<row header="no">
				<cell>Number of voters</cell>
				<cell>96</cell>
				<cell>100</cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>1st choice</cell>
				<cell>A</cell>
				<cell>B</cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>2nd choice</cell>
				<cell>B</cell>
				<cell>A</cell>
			</row>
		</tabular>
		</sidebyside>
		<p>
			Suppose a third candidate, C, entered the race, and a segment of voters sincerely want to vote for that third candidate. Here is the new preference schedule.
		</p>
		<sidebyside>
		<tabular halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
			<row header="no">
				<cell>Number of voters</cell>
				<cell>96</cell>
				<cell>90</cell>
				<cell>10</cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>1st choice</cell>
				<cell>A</cell>
				<cell>B</cell>
				<cell>C</cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>2nd choice</cell>
				<cell>B</cell>
				<cell>A</cell>
				<cell>B</cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>3rd choice</cell>
				<cell>C</cell>
				<cell>C</cell>
				<cell>A</cell>
			</row>
		</tabular>
		</sidebyside>
		<p>
			The ten people who prefer candidate C are in a bind because if they vote for C, then A will win, but they prefer B over A. It is likely that they will vote for B, their second choice, to keep A from winning.
		</p>
		</statement>
	</example>
	<p>
		Situations like this can lead to insincere voting. <alert>Insincere voting</alert> is when a person doesn't vote according to their actual preference for strategic purposes. In the case above, a person who wants to vote for a third-party candidate realizes it would take a vote away from their major party candidate. Not wanting to see their party lose the election, they vote for the major party candidate.
	</p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>Instant Runoff Method</title>
	<p>
		The <alert>Instant Runoff Method</alert> is a modification of the plurality method that attempts to address the issue of insincere voting.
	</p>
	<p>
		The voting is done with ranked choice ballots and a preference schedule is generated. Then we tally all the first-choice votes. The candidate with the <em>least</em> first-place votes is eliminated, but any votes for that candidate are transferred to the voters' next choice. The process continues until one candidate has a majority. We will show you how it works with an example.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Consider the preference schedule below, in which a committee is choosing a chairperson. The candidates are labeled A, B, C, D, and E for simplicity. Here is the preference schedule:

		The Instant Runoff Method is similar to the idea of holding runoff elections, but since every voter's order of preference is recorded on the ballot, the runoff can be computed quickly without requiring a second costly election. It also makes it safe to vote for a third-party candidate knowing that your vote will go to your second choice if your first choice can't win.
	</p>
	<p>
		This voting method is used in several places around the world, including the election of members of the Australian House of Representatives, statewide elections in Maine, and local elections in Benton County, Oregon (Ranked Choice Voting Resource Center, 2020).

<subsection>
<title>Borda Count (Point System)</title>
	<p>
		Borda Count is another voting method, named for Jean-Charles de Borda, who developed the system in 1770. In this method, points are assigned to each candidate based on their ranking; 1 point for last choice, 2 points for second-to-last choice, and so on. The point values are totaled, and the candidate with the largest point total is the winner. We'll show you how to do it in the next example.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			A group of PCC students are getting together for a student leadership conference and they need to decide where to meet. Their members are from four campuses: Sylvania, Rock Creek, Cascade and Southeast. The votes for where to hold the conference were:

			We will start with Sylvania in the bottom row and move up. They have one point times 14 voters, 2 points times 25 + 10 voters, 3 points times zero, and 4 points times 31 voters. Multiplying and then adding gives us a total of 208 points for Sylvania. You can see the calculation below and we will do the same thing for each campus:

			Using the Borda count method, Rock Creek is the winning location.

	<p>
		Note that Sylvania would have won with the plurality method. Borda count is sometimes described as a consensus-based voting system, since it can be used to choose a more broadly acceptable option over the one with the most first-choice support. This is a different approach than plurality and instant runoff voting that focus on first-choice votes; Borda Count considers every voter's entire ranking to determine the outcome.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because of this consensus behavior, Borda Count, or some variation of it, is commonly used in awarding sports awards. Variations are used to determine the Most Valuable Player in baseball, to rank teams in NCAA sports, and to award the Heisman trophy.

<title>Pairwise Comparison: Copeland's Method</title>
	<p>
		Another method, called <alert>pairwise comparison</alert>, the <alert>Condorcet method</alert> or <alert>Copeland's method</alert>, attempts to be fair by looking at each pair of candidates separately.
	</p>
	<p>
		In this method, we look at each pair as if they were the only two candidates running and determine which of the two is more preferred. In Copeland's method, the more preferred candidate is awarded 1 point. If there is a tie, each candidate is awarded <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> point. After all the pairwise comparisons are made, the candidate with the most points, and hence the most pairwise wins, is declared the winner.
	</p>
	<p>
		Variations of Copeland's Method are used in many professional organizations, including election of the Board of Trustees for the Wikimedia Foundation that runs Wikipedia.

			We need to look at each pair of candidates to see which would win in a one-to-one comparison. First, we will systematically list all of the pairs of candidates:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						Helena vs. Omar
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Helena vs. Ana
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Ana vs. Omar
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Next, comparing Helena with Omar, we see that 6 voters, those marked in bold in the table below, would prefer Helena over Omar. Note that Helena doesn't have to be the voter's first choice – we're imagining that Ana wasn't in the race. The other 4 people chose Omar over Helena.
		</p>

		<tabular halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">

				<cell><alert>O</alert></cell>
				<cell>A</cell>
				<cell><alert>O</alert></cell>
			</row>
		</tabular>
		</sidebyside>
		<p>
			Based on this comparison of Helena vs. Omar, Helena wins 1 point.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next, comparing Helena with Ana, the 6 voters in the last two columns prefer Helena to Ana, so Helena gets one point. Lastly, we compare Ana with Omar. The 1 voter in the first column prefers Ana, as do the 3 voters in the second column. The 3 voters in the third column prefer Omar, but the 3 voters in the last column would choose Ana. So, altogether <m>1+3+3=7</m> voters prefer Ana over Omar. Ana gets 1 point.
		</p>
		<p>
			To summarize, we write how many voters prefer each candidate ignoring all other candidates:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						Helena-6 vs Omar-4 (Helena gets 1 point)
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Helena-6 vs Ana-4 (Helena gets 1 point)
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Ana-7 vs Omar-3 (Ana gets 1 point)
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Ana has a total of 1 point and Helena has 2 points, so Helena is the winner under Copeland's Method. This method gave us a different winner than the plurality method where Ana won, because more people preferred Helena to Ana, even though they didn't choose Helena for their first choice.

	<p>
		Notice that in this election: 10 people prefer A to B, 10 people prefer B to C, and 10 people prefer C to A.
	</p>
	<p>
		No matter whom we choose as the winner, <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> of voters would prefer someone else! This scenario is called <alert>Condorcet's Voting Paradox</alert>. In this situation, there is no fair resolution. There are many additional paradoxes and fairness criteria that are explained in David Lippman's original version of <em>Math in Society</em><fn><url href="http://www.opentextbookstore.com/mathinsociety/index.html" visual="opentextbookstore.com/mathinsociety">Math in Society: Voting Theory</url>, by David Lippman</fn>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since it is not possible to have one method that is fair in every situation, it is important to decide which method is the most fair for any given situation.
	</p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
	<title>Primaries and Sequential Voting</title>
	<p>
		For many public offices in the U.S., a sequence of two public votes is held: a primary election and the general election. For non-partisan offices like sheriff and judge, in which political party affiliation is not declared, the primary election is usually used to narrow the field of candidates.
	</p>
	<p>
		For partisan positions, typically, either the top two candidates receiving the most votes move forward, or the top candidate from each party will move forward. This is called <alert>sequential voting</alert> - a process in which voters cast totally new ballots after each round of eliminations. Sequential voting has become quite common in television, where it is used in reality shows like <em>The Voice</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In some states a <alert>closed primary</alert> is used, in which only voters of each party can vote for that party's candidates. In other states, an <alert>open primary</alert> is used, where voters can pick the party whose primary they want to vote in. In other states, <alert>caucuses</alert> are used, which are meetings of the political parties, only open to party members. Closed primaries are often disliked by independent voters, who like the flexibility to change which party they are voting in. Open primaries have the disadvantage of raiding, though, where a voter could vote in their non-preferred party's primary with the intent of selecting a weaker opponent for their preferred party's candidate.
	</p>
	<p>
		Regardless of the primary type, the general election is the main election. While rules vary state-to-state, for an independent or minor party candidate to get listed on the ballot, they typically have to gather a certain number of signatures to petition for inclusion.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the next section we will look at a different type of election for the President of the United States.

		Copeland's Method is designed to identify a Condorcet Candidate if there is one, and is considered a Condorcet Method. There are many Condorcet Methods, which vary primarily in how they deal with ties, which are very common when a Condorcet winner does not exist. Copeland's method does not have a tie-breaking procedure built-in. Research the Schulze method, another Condorcet method that is used by the Wikimedia foundation that runs Wikipedia, and give some examples of how it works.

		In a primary system, a first vote is held with multiple candidates. In many states, where voters must declare a party to vote in the primary election, and they are only able to choose between candidates for their declared party. The top candidate from each party then advances to the general election. Compare and contrast this primary with general election system to instant runoff voting, considering both differencesin the methods, and practical differences like cost, campaigning, fairness, etc.

		Sometimes in a voting scenario it is desirable to rank the candidates, either to establish preference order between a set of choices, or because the election requires multiple winners.  For example, a hiring committee may have 30 candidates apply, and need to select 6 to interview, so the voting by the committee would need to produce the top 6 candidates. Describe how Plurality, Instant Runoff Voting, Borda Count, and Copeland's Method could be extended to produce a ranked list of candidates.
